<!--TRANSCRIPT
{"transcript": [{"speaker": 1, "line": " Hello everyone, welcome to episode 42 of the day Zero podcast on Specter with me is zi before we start the show. We will be doing another reminder that we are going to be going on a break May 25th is going to be our last episode. So that is next week. I believe. Yep. I just wanted to double-check that. So yeah next week will be our last episode. We're coming back on September 14th, which is like Midway through September. So, you know, what will be on for a few months just over the summer while we're you know working on stuff but I want to let you guys know that in advance, you know, that way you guys don't come here and like two weeks and then there's there's nothing here. So yeah, we just wanted to get that out of the way and the next thing we have before that before we get into any like new news is actually an update to the story that we covered last week with the Huawei. Interestingness that we saw so last week we covered a colonel bug that was super trivial and it was like a security subsystem. It was really it was really awesome because there was a very blatant buffer overflow and it was the security subsystem. It was called HKS P. So you wanted to say something there zi.", "start": 9.8}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Well, yeah, this was kind of my update on that because I had I made some comments that maybe are true. Maybe you're not true. It's not clear at this point gr. Securities also. And update their posts, but the key thing here is with HKS B, which was the Huawei Colonel self-protect system basically email was sent out on Friday before the last episode with these patches various security features to basically prevent messing with the colonel trying to stop some exploits. I'll during when we talk about that. I mentioned how it appears that this wasn't somebody from Huawei that it wasn't actually Huawei sending this out instead. It was somebody in this is in the first line of the get Hub on the readme itself makes a mention that Actually looks like they might have removed the repository. Oh, no, there it is. They just rename debt, but on that first line there mentions that that basically they're not from Huawei or they're not this was done on personal time. So I took that to mean that this person had worked on this, you know on their own whether or not they were with Huawei they do use while ways Organization for their account, but that's just like typed in it's not an actual like connection to when he Huawei corporate account. Despite that what's kind of come out now is one that the comment actually with that statement saying how they're not actually how this isn't actually from Huawei while the committee for that was on Friday before they emailed the Linux kernel hardening list before gr. Scary did that like it was in theory in there before that? The actual push event wasn't until Monday morning after the response had already come to the from gr. Security and all that. So basically after people want shop back about the vulnerability and there and just bad coding then this mysterious commit backdated to Friday was pushed which definitely kind of leads to A bit of a question as to", "start": 78.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " it is pretty suspicious. Yeah.", "start": 218.5}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah, at least kind of to the question of whether or not while way is behind and trying to backpedal a bit or if this is just kind of Somebody who genuinely was just working on their own time kind of built this and it got associated with Huawei somewhat unintentionally, gr. Security pushes that this guy is an employee of Huawei one of their highest Bible is going", "start": 220.5}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " to say not just an employee. They say a level 20 principal security stuffer, which is like the highest level apparently at the company. So", "start": 247.5}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " yeah, so I don't know what they're in for me what their sources for that. I don't have access to that. That said I do feel like the commit being backdated is definitely very suspicious. I mean had they just added that commit after you know, gr. Security called sounds like oh, I better make it clear that hey, I'm not actually, you know with Huawei or whatever and Huawei I just chose to use that for some reason, you know, it won't be a little bit different but the fact that they backdated that commits definitely, you know, something's going on with that. So I'm kind of a little bit more willing to toss some belief into the idea that while way was maybe planning on using this obviously they weren't using it yet. There's definitely like there's definitely the possibility that's not that that genuinely is just somebody that you know, he also just worked on this on their own time whether or not he's a principal security or developer, whatever.", "start": 254.1}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " I have a question here too. It's like I'm looking at the repo right now. All I see is the top patch file was it always like that?", "start": 321.5}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah. It was just the readme in the patch", "start": 328.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " file and and it was like that even before like all the Jer security. Okay. I just want to make sure because that seemed kind of weird that the repo seen more empty than I remember it being", "start": 329.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " but no that was just it was just that at least on Monday. I can't go back further than well. Why I say Miami last Monday? Yeah, I can recall that was just the two files then. Okay,", "start": 339.1}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " so I mean, yeah, the commit date is pretty suspicious and it's kind of worrying that they're top security staffer is putting out code like this it is is pretty questionable.", "start": 352.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Well, so on that like I'd be willing to believe that their focus was on these patches and what these patches could do and protect from whereas the particular vulnerability that gets called out if I recall correctly. It's Was it not in like one of the handlers by just basically the caller? Basically? Let me see if I can find it from dear security again. okay, stay right, so Yeah, it was just in the ring", "start": 360.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " callback for the aisle or for the device.", "start": 396.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " So yeah, so sorry. I was thinking. I was trying to come up with a charitable way to explain it away. I just being like, okay. Well, this was just kind of some throwaway code. The focus was on all these checks and you know Screw adding in all the security elsewhere. Let's focus on these checks which are kind of the primary. functionality of this is kind of what I was thinking", "start": 398.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " but It is like it is just really blatant lie, like just not", "start": 428.3}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " security. No, I like it. All there's definitely just no thought towards that here.", "start": 435.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " Yeah, but I would say going I will say even though this like that commit day does look suspicious and I while we didn't know it at the time there is a security staffer like this guy is not just, you know random person out there. That's not affiliated with Huawei. He does work at Huawei. I I do think it's it still seems Reasonable not to attach it to Huawei just because looking at the past repos on the account. You can tell it's an individual account. It's not you know, it's not a corporate account or anything like that. I think that's one of the I want to say. It's the only one but there might be like one or two others but like there's a lot of repose that aren't affiliated with anything while way attach that account as well. So it does seem reason. I don't think it's reasonable to attribute that to Huawei like Huawei never tied their name to that code. So Even though there is like a bit as of a suspicious story around it and people like the common thing I've seen is this is a back door, right? But while we're trying to put some druggie just mentioned", "start": 440.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " that in chat, actually the whole situation is weird. Some people claiming it's a backdoor attempt but it's not even remotely subtle. Maybe there is a miscommunication between employees and Huawei or maybe you always backpedaling because of the shit", "start": 500.0}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " code a lot more likely than a back door in my opinion.", "start": 513.3}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah, so when it comes to the back door like I get why People are always cautious, you know Chinese companies therefore, you know trying to can just make them do whatever the thing is with that generally speaking the bag door from China is all the data is passing through Chinese servers. Therefore it can be logged collected and then China is allowed to store it or sorry. And then the Chinese government is basically up to accept when they want to and I believe that's basically mandated by law that they will have to Give access to that data, they collect so the back door is just fact, they have all the data passing through already. And that's where Loft concern from trying to comes from that said, I mean, obviously there is valid concern while way building out anything that's going to be used by, you know, obviously they have phones could be used by government officials. Those could be back doors like there's reasons to that backdooring also, But a lot of the Chinese back doors are really just the fact that the government's there when it comes to something like this. I'm definitely I'm not I'm willing to say like Huawei doesn't want their name on this. Obviously. I don't think it's a back door, even though it could it be used like that sure. It's definitely very obvious. Like I said, I do kind of want to have that more charitable understanding here and just say that okay, this is kind of like Oh, it's in the right. It's not the important part of the application. They just kind of wrote row there right Handler here.", "start": 516.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " And just had the lesson that system like it's not their main area. I see what you're going with", "start": 615.3}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " that. Yeah like that Focus what you want to break our all those checks that", "start": 620.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " they're actually doing on everything.", "start": 623.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " You can implement this securely quite easily.", "start": 626.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " Yeah, like what I'll say on the back door angle is kind of like what your view is saying in chat is if you're going to do a back door, you don't want it to be super obvious like that. If you can plant a bug plant the subtle one because you don't want other people to find and Potentially expose the bug so you are forced to fix it or you just don't want other people abusing that bug, you know, if you have the ability to plant a bug you don't want to plant something that obvious that's just really stupid. So that's why I think it's not I don't think there's enough evidence really to suggest that it could be a backdoor. I think that's kind of a bit tinfoil hat to tinfoil hat for me.", "start": 629.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah. I mean people definitely like hating on kind of they'll for the back door idea like anytime there's a Ready vulnerability, there's always the rumors about oh, it's a backdoor. Whatever and yeah, I do agree with you in this case", "start": 669.3}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " station to be fair with all the like stuff that they do like, it's not like it's unknown to to them to do stuff like that. But oh here I just don't think it's it's fair to say that without anything like anything more substantial basically.", "start": 682.0}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah. No, I agree with that. Either way. I think we just want to bring this up is Biff and updates there have been some changes from what I said. Mostly I didn't realize that that commits had the suspicious a date on it. So I want to kind of call that out.", "start": 699.0}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " So we'll move on to some zi rhodium. So zi rhodium, for those of you who don't know. It's basically their an exploit broker, right? So they buy exploits for various things like Windows iOS Android pretty much anything. That's a high-value Target. They purchase exploits for and they put out a tweet on May 13th saying they will not be acquiring any new Apple iOS LP. He's webkit exploits or sandbox escapes from the next two to three months because there's such a high volume of Missions for those vectors and they said even after they start accepting submissions again prices for one click chains, like webkit chains, for example, without persistence will probably drop so these chains if I remember I can't remember if it was two million or one I think 0 click iOS chain to Colonel route with persistence was two million dollars before I'm guessing that's", "start": 717.2}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " probably because I'm not sure what it is right now because I know like we've been seeing none really. The iOS dropping. Okay. Yeah, so was 2 million but we have seen Android kind of come up there with Android they're offering up to 2.5 million.", "start": 771.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " Yeah,", "start": 787.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " and that's kind of that was back and I think September when the price of an Android 0 click was worth more than an iOS 0 click. Yeah, so we've been seeing that change. So this one I mean, obviously the fact that they're not accepting new submissions. Like the big thing about zi rhodium is the fact that they've been a very public broker that's just kind of always buying issues just like you find an issue you can kind of go to them and sell their you", "start": 789.0}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " don't know you need it weaponize though. Oh, yeah. It just accepted", "start": 820.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " who needs what I mean. Is there always accepting issues though? It's not like they're matching you up with a Fire immediately. Yeah, that's what I mean like there that's very public broker. That's consistently just they're open to just buying the issues. They just have their list here of things they're interested in and you can contact them about other things but You can basically just go to them and sell at any point. They're not waiting for particular buyers for anything. It's just sell it to us and we'll sell it on her own timer. Whatever.

They're not, you know, you're not going to find a website for you to submit stuff to them. They mostly deal with like, you know behind closed doors kind of stuff. So zi rhodium offers a really useful insight for people into that area. Area of like how much things are worth like these charts on zi rhodium and the statements they put out offering Insight that you probably otherwise wouldn't really get into the grey market with exploit stuff though. That's why I just kind of wanted to highlight that we're bringing this up is Eridium does offer that unique Insight that you can't really get from other sources like yeah, you have zi zi, but that's different. Right? They're not selling to Great Market. They're purchasing so that they can alert their clients in advance and they're going to be they're going to their payouts are going to be like 10 times less.

Yeah, like I don't think I think they actually mentioned that maybe not but I don't think they've ever really just like they have stopped accepting submissions on some things but not in this sort of temporary way as far as I'm aware. So it definitely seems like I'm wondering if I'm wondering what led to the increase its emissions. So obviously you can take that as one of two things demand has dropped for them and they have like more stockpile than they even need. Or well, I guess it's kind of two sides of the same coin coin but or just there's been a lot more submissions such that there isn't enough demand for it. I'm curious kind of which way it went if it was too many submissions or if it was just nobody's asking for them", "start": 934.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " anymore. I have a feeling it's probably the former just because like just from like exploits. We've covered on Day Zero and stuff this year. I don't know if it's just like a recency bias or something like that. But it seems like we have covered a lot more Apple issues this year than I remember even seeing last year and we're not even like halfway through the year yet. So it does seem like there's a lot more Apple issues being discovered. I'm not sure if that's just because it's being looked at more, you know, people are starting to realize how valuable You will have a Target. It is more people are looking at it or if it's just because there's newer code making it into the code base that isn't being vetted properly. Like if there was like a staffing change or something. I don't know but I think either way you look at it. I think there has been a lot more activity in the iOS exploitation field this year than any year previous. It's just keeps growing.", "start": 993.8}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah, certainly 16 like I agree with you on hearing more in the past year about about iOS exploits that said Yeah, I don't know like I guess I don't know if that's necessarily related to just because there's also just kind of an increasing more and more people are continually publishing interesting exploits now rather than just kind of selling them off or reporting them or whatever like just in general. There's an increase on seeing those write-ups and stuff too. So it could be a bias relate to that and not actually more people or more findings.

Yeah, and it's weird. Because Android is to it is easier to hit than iOS make no mistake because iOS has like they have stronger sandboxing as far as I know than Android and they have medications that Android doesn't have yet. Android doesn't have a pointer authentication. For example, where iOS has had that for what one or two years now and that's that's not exactly trivial to get around when you're talking about like iOS kernel exploits and stuff like that.

And I think the fact is that iOS just has the highest challenge of pretty much anything out there and that's why it's so popular of a Target among, you know, really smart people what will be interesting to see how this though is if that money will be A motivating factor to see if people who have in the past exclusively done iOS research start to spread out to other targets if it'd be interesting to see if we see some of those Iowa Skies start to move to Android or to order browsers or something like see if they move or where they move to I think that'll be very interesting to see if that happens over the next few months.", "start": 1186.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Well, no, I think part of it like they do just mention that there only They're not accepting those for the next two to three months due to the high number of submissions.

It's it's a very complicated field so that kind of matches that you know challenge aspect that that bottom phone security researchers along it's a hard target to hit. It needs a lot of re and research and stuff like that because you know, Morse code isn't For a lot of hypervisors out there. So I think hypervisor expectations might start to see a rise. My see can start to see more stuff related to that in the future. So that could be fun to see I wanted to bring something up from the jerky put in chat apples Iowa's 13 has been particularly buggy enough that SVP software engineering reported overhauled the company's internal software testing process to avoid a repeat when I was 14 rolls around Yeah, and I mean, I think I've actually seen that from some of the iOS for researchers like follow on Twitter as well is IOS 13 is just had like a myriad of issues. So it's probably it might be a combination of both with iOS, you know with them not wanting to pay for them with the supply going up is it's probably more issues being found because code made it into Iowa's 13 that is bad and wasn't vetted properly combined with the fact that it's probably more people looking at it. And like you said zi, especially with the covid situation even more so so I think it's just it's a combination of things.

There's a quote from I don't see a source on who sang it but basically mention that the zero day Market is so flooded by iOS exploit that we've recently started refusing some of them. Just mentioned that that's a wired so I'm not sure who they are because I don't think wired was that fun buying it. It's at least I would assume that wired was anti guess that could be some investigative journalism tool, but that said if that wasn't September so there yeah, I mean we could see a movie out of iOS or perhaps it is just I was 13 once we see new iOS, maybe that'll That'll bring more people in or not.

So it's spaced you can see on the page there space security challenge 2020. And as you can guess by the name, you know hack us at it's about satellite hacking or space space technology in general. So this weekend is a Jeopardy style CTF. Anybody can play but the team lead and contacts do need to speak English and I believe it's at least your team lead needs to be a US citizen or resident permanent resident. So that is one of the limitations of it you can play but I don't think You don't think you can qualify for the final or yeah, the prize is otherwise, there's some other restrictions related like government to government employees participating and how they can participate they can't use government facilities various things like", "start": 1492.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " that.

They do actually making explicit mention about how you can't be participating in an official capacity as part of your job or related to your job things like that. Nonetheless didn't want to call it out because that is this week and it's something different. It's cyber security cell. So we'll be like your Jeopardy style CTF, but they do mention they've got an emphasis on space system. So the FAQ mentioned a few of the categories Uh-huh, which include stuff like communication with satellites knowing the tools and the protocols hacking satellite applications over the message bus their Communications via like modem RF Communications payload modules flight software orbital mechanics. They also mentioned calling out some of the science the astronomy and astrophysics orbital mechanics and various space algorithms for Star Trek navigation. So things like that. Seems like it'll be a kind of an interesting CTF. I don't know how like I have no idea how hard the challenges will be but seems like one of those CTF so you can play just if you've got an interest in kind of the space tack that all kind of force you to learn some effect and give you a little bit experience and then the top 10 teams get an invite to the final event which uses Flats at with a fully automatic satellite, basically. Kind of for the communication aspect and then it's kind of like a virtual aided virtually of what what type of word is that a virtual / simulated space environment as far as I know you don't actually get to hack a satellite. That's it. They do call the last stage of this there on orbit challenge which they limit you to only two submissions. Which I mean the way they say that sounds like you may actually get to send a payload against an actual satellite.

It's a very interesting theme and it will be interesting to see like you were talking about like, you know, I'll be all the algorithms that go into like the astrophysics and stuff of it.

They're making it clear that you should know about these things. You can prep for it. They're probably trying to find teams that could do this type of work. I mean, I don't think this is recruitment or anything or at least they explicitly mention the licenses and like recruitment that there won't be any job offers or anything out of it, but I could understand if they were making this with a focus on.

So qualifiers usually don't have very large prizes, but this qualifier actually has ten fifteen thousand dollar prizes for I would say the top 10 teams, but I'm guessing the top 10 qualified teams because you know, if you have a team lead that isn't a u.s.

Although actually, it was drooly out of chat and up dragging me into working on one. But so I played just two of the web challenges upload and poot. Oh or upload it. I think it's called actually, I'll say the challenges. Look what some of the past challenges I felt like there's been some guesswork some mind-reading needed for it. And that was kind of my feeling I think when we talk about Defcon calls last year. Yeah. I kind of", "start": 2042.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " mentioned a for high opinion of the calls last year if I remember right?", "start": 2077.5}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " Yeah. So this year I still have some issues especially with one of the challenges that I worked on that. I kind of felt like they just laughed a lot of Direction on The Challenge so I can't say that was for everything but in particular pooped and I'll give people a warning I am going to spoil it here as I talk about it. So if you don't want any spoilers, you know Skip ahead or mute for mute for a moment, but with poot it was a simple kind of web proxy that he had Source was provided you could find in the comments of the HTML acts to the source just like a python flask application. Ation, so fairly standard for a web app web app challenge providing Source. It was a proxy you give it a URL like domain path and it'll make a request using python request and it'll replace our own replace all of the links. I rewrite all the lengths basically just what you'd expect from low webpage proxy had a admin that would if you sent a feedback saying like hey, this page doesn't work and admin would visit that page they would visit That page through the proxy and then you could break out of the proxy and actually have make some requests using that add the admins browser. That's kind of hinted at in the description in the description talks about our secure poot proxy allows you to continue browsing securely and hide your IP address from your visited website. So breaking out a fact it's kind of clear that that's kind of what you're about. Somebody's using the proxy you're trying to break out or break through it. That said once you broke through it, there's no real guidance left to know kind of where to go from there the solution like I know both myself and a number of other teams looked at the red acid. Use the redis Q is so kind of look that tried to communicate with that system and try to communicate with other internal systems some enumeration and I know is I was doing the enumeration I did that myself to definitely I was like it was. Didn't feel like the right route to go like I mean. Lot of these seats like that's more half the box or something that will have you brute force. Nonetheless, they didn't give any real Direction on what to do from there. So that issue I think kind of remains from the past like there are there is some mine during those necessary in this case. I do think there are some very minor changes that could have been made to this challenge. That would have made it clear or that would have provided a little bit of a hint saying what to do but the actual solution ended up being installing a service worker so you can intercept all the requests that The admin makes to the proxy and you'll find that they make a request to a page with the flag. That said figuring out that you should be installing a service worker it once you your exhume JavaScript on the admins browser, which is just a headless Chrome. You can do so many things from there. There's no without any guidance like because there's so many possibilities even though that challenge wasn't that hard. I think it only have like 18 to 20 solves. I'm not sure what it was at the end. But the last time I looked it was only 18 solves. Have they had any guidance that hinted towards? Like the admin browser accessing something else. That could have gone off and it cut felt a little bit more fair because there was something like I'd kind of mentioned I thought like if they just added with that statement, you know, continue your browsing securely and hide your IP address if they just said like in hide your browser history from your ISP or something just a little saving like that. It's enough of a hint that if you think about it after your on the admin to know to go after the history. It could work but it's not enough that it would spoil things like that. And I felt that about something other challenges in past years to there's like the browser user agent one or just some slight tweaks to give guidance on your an appropriate approach for each stage would have been useful and I guess I'd really Echo that same thing back here is it really comes down to just making sure as you design a challenge, how are people going to? Come up with the appropriate process and I get it. There's a balance that needs to be maintained their difficult challenge. You don't want to give everything away. But you also don't want to leave it as so wide open like this one was it's like there's so many possibilities. There's no real indication that You know, I service workers right? Thank you. Just have to kind of think of it and know what and I will say the other one I worked on was uploaded it. Which flask app really small think I actually I saw the right path to that really quickly and then was just too lazy to actually do it", "start": 2080.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " or not. So one thing you see especially in Defcon CTF for whatever reason is you love to see one challenges get solved in a way that's different from the intended solution and in the reverse engineering server, somebody actually linked to right up to one of those challenges. It was not be fooled and it was supposed to be a additive transfer. Pack on a quote curve cryptography, which I'm not familiar with but they actually solved it in a like are easier way than the challenge was intended to be solved. They provided the the task script which was written in Sage but Sage was on python 2 for a while. So it was a good guess that it was running python 2 for this challenge as well and the input function in Python to evaluates the input and receives so you could literally a just right in Echo or stock STD ODOT right open flag dot read and just print out the flag.

Yeah input and python like just calling input evaluates what you provided like that is there's another function Thon to called raw input which will just read input which is what I want to see you should be using but I don't actually I don't want to make that claim because that very well might be another fuck gun, but I know input itself is commonly used and yeah it evaluates everything you kind of put in there. There was another one that was kind of solved. Oh I didn't I don't have the right I prepared here, but it was Like bios, of course, all their challenges have like three O's in it, but the idea was you had to read the flag from a floppy disk, but you didn't have an operating system. We didn't have a bio so you had to do all of that yourself and do the VGA output yourself. Um, I'm not so Bleak ass bios less was easy wasn't I'm not sure what its ring was. I didn't even try the challenge. I only did those two web ones. I was kind of sick through the weekend. So I wasn't playing too hard wasn't playing competitively at all. I just like I said looked at that upload one saw the solution kind of quickly, but didn't actually bother with it and then Drew he got me interested in pooped. So I worked on that for a bit. I wasn't playing family I dance. the most challenges but the solution they ended up had I known we'd be talking about the intended solution I have tried to have this one ready but basically they ended up just abusing the fact that it was running on qemu and you some functionality of that to get output rather than actually implementing like their own VGA right or anything from the floppy they just abuse qemu for it", "start": 2526.6}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " I found it funny some people were saying this was like Huey and you CTF because like there were a lot of challenges that were there were virtualized and qemu because I think there was a colonel exploit one to that I actually kind of want to look at because it the details of it that I saw from people who were trying to solve it looked really interesting but one of the things I wanted to shout out before we you know move on is the source code for all of the challenges for the CTF went out like basically instantly so definitely not a decently Not instantly, but very close to the time that the CTF ended like I think it went up like 17 hours ago for", "start": 2652.4}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " all the sources like I don't think Source.

We have one in vbulletin. So I will be honest vbulletin is a forum software and forms are kind of dead nowadays. So I don't know how many people are actually using people and anymore. But um, the issue that this exploit talks about seems to be in the infraction subsystem. So if you've ever used forms before Reddit basically killed them all especially the bullet and moderators can give infractions to people right which is Kris is like a point counter on the user's account and sends them a warning message. And when a threshold of points has reached the user automatically gets banned or some kind of punitive action happens, right? So they have an endpoint in their API for getting infraction related information, which I'm assuming the end point they abused which is get indexable content didn't have permission checks in it.

SQL injection, so it was a very straightforward SQL. I was just a single quote Union and the other thing is with people with and it's not blind because anyone with the bulletin concede the database structure to easily exploit this you know, it's not like you don't know anything about the table structure or anything like that. So it was it was fairly easy to abuse what I found interesting though was the way they actually abuse the sqli to you know, make it useful. So basically what they did. Did was they use the sqli multiple times to like pull off multi-stage attack to basically reset the admin password. So they used it to get admin details like the email and the username and then they use it again. They created the captcha instance and then they get the capture answer from the database using the SQL. I they then force a password reset and they retrieve the token from the database and use that token to set a password that they control and then from there they can just back door it. So yeah, the issue is fairly trivial. I did like how the flaw could keep being abused to get all the information needed for the stages. I'm assuming they needed to do that because they probably couldn't directly modify the table data.

You don't have to have a database storing all your user information. It's just kind of stored on the page. You still need to track some user information of course, but there's a lot of stuff that you can just track kind of in this view State value. Because it's stored on the client.

Gets the phone number in and a linked call with Google Voice. So that's kind of where it creates that. believe it creates a field somewhere else also in there, but and then it goes through and if it's if there are any child elements on this it'll just replace the inner HTML if the parent or if there are no child elements, it will replace the inner HTML if the parent node with this tag that it created and if there are any child element, then it all insert before so just insert it as the first element this take that it's created.

No dot inner HTML assignment and the next sink is the insert before so he makes it seem like that's where the issue comes in. Not that VC.

There's actually a few issues at play here. So users with maintenance privileges in this isn't in this software can perform SQL and XML dumps and there's no see sort of checking on that functionality and they also allow a get parameter to specify a different file to back up to from the default one. So you can kind of see where this is going. They can specify where they want to write an SQL dump to So you can you can just dump the SQL to a publicly accessible folder from Webroot because it doesn't really protect against past reversal.

They get it kind of indicates that there there's probably deeper issues which of course there are because we're talking about it. So um, so yeah with that I'll jump back to the SQL stuff. So the SQL file the database file is not just an SQL file. It's a it's a gzipped SQL file. So if you can partially control the contents of the database you can craft at a polyglot gzip and PHP file to embed like a shell into it. So they go through some of the process that they had for doing that so, you know be able to pull off an attack like that you want to have the structure of the database that you're you're constructing the polyglot with so that's where they kind of get into this hidden get parameter, which is yet another kind of Oddity that on its own isn't too powerful when chained allows them to do the rce and that's that they have this GOP I events table that they dumped here let me just scroll down to it because I don't have it written down in my notes for some reason okay there we go yeah so they have this get parameter offset table and they can actually dump the table with that with that variable so you can see they have a dump of the table dump table GOP I Wi-Fi networks and they just have the table structure of that Wi-Fi network and there's a little election in their comment which you can set if your maintenance user so you know for the rest of the issues that they hit for this rce they do a Sit assume that you have some level of access they assume that you have access to the panel through like a maintenance user or something like that they theorize later on that it might be possible without that but for now they assume that you know you have that level of access so one of the things that a maintenance person can do is they can add a new Wi-Fi network and they can add a comment on that and that allows you a decent degree of control over the data that's going into that database file against gzipped so they go through how they construct that payload so one", "start": 4990.3}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " thing I so I will kind of mention here really quickly is that hidden gift parameter basically what it's doing is it will dump like all the cables using that you are off the content by using that he basically provide the offset into it for to dump so won't dump everything so that way your control of the data that data that you actually control can be very early on in that dump if not like the first thing that actually comes out if the dump which is important when they come into attacking the gzip That way they're not having too much noise from blobs earlier", "start": 5117.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " on. though they go through some of the hurdles they had with constructing that payload apparently gzip has some like anti xss filters in it, which I didn't know about that they", "start": 5155.0}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " had because it doesn't application does", "start": 5169.0}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " Okay, I misread then.

I read that as in being in gzip. So that was my bad. Okay, so gzip, you know, they they encode the characters properly. So that's obviously an issue when you're trying to inject PHP code, right? You need the lesser than question mark or you need an opening PHP tag. There's a few different ones to go. They don't actually go with the question mark PHP one, so they found so they found kind of an interesting solution around that instead of trying to embed the PHP tag themselves. They actually use the uncompressed block header, which can have a value that decodes to a lesser than character depending on the length so they can get a tag in a compressed block. But the code they had to execute would be in the uncompressed block and this is kind of tricky because there's data that you control between the opening tag and the shell content. This is what you were kind of talking about with the noise. You can't have like invalid PHP code in between the tag and where you inject your shell or it's just gonna fail so that's where they kind of get into some of the interesting things you can do with PHP tags. I actually didn't know about this tag. You can just use well, it's actually not I guess an official tag, but they use the lesser than question mark equals tag, so I haven't seen that. before but apparently not sit for like echoing and stuff like", "start": 5187.2}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " that it's an official take it's the short yeah I miss well it's half the short bring their so in particular equals is specifically it'll Echo whatever you put out next so that way you don't have to do like if you're using PHP a morph like the templating style so you have like an HTML file or dot PHP and just in there you have like angle bracket question mark rather than doing Echo value you undo equals value it's just kind of a shorthand for doing an Ecco that said as you're going to get into what they kind of abuse this see you can give it a double quote string so PHP does shrink shrinks differently depending on how you quota so double quoted string will interpret variables that are inside if it wears a single quote we'll just do the literal string so even if you put like dollar sign some bar it'll actually print the dollar sign what they end up doing and started to kind of steal your thunder a little bit Checkers you're going to get into that is they end up doing a quote or comment sorry now start comment start of a multi-line comment that is so like slash star so that way they can inject that in what in the compressed output and then unquote at as long as you know they don't accidentally get a star / anywhere before their actual injection they can just unquote and then their actual injection have acts of the PHP I thought that was an interesting way to go about and I didn't know you could quote like that in the equals or after like the question mark equal sign I mean I've never really tried usually if you're using like question mark equals you're doing that because it's short so you're usually not putting quotes there so yeah I just didn't know you could do", "start": 5266.1}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " that there yeah it is kind of an interesting trick that they use the comment and then they basically comment out that second compressed blocks data so it won't get interpreted but like I was saying they're like I didn't even know about that tag the the question mark equals tag obviously I'm guessing the way you're talking about is a you've known about it I don't know if you've used it but that's kind of new to me I feel kind of bad because I like it's been a while since I've written PHP code and I don't write it regularly but I'm just I was kind of surprised I didn't know what that

like it wasn't super straightforward because generating that sequence of characters isn't really something you can easily control right it's based on the compressed block length and stuff like that so they had to kind of brute force that to get it to work so they they ran a script and ran it like overnight or something I can't remember if they said exactly how long it took to brute force it but there was a bit of brute forcing involved but they were able to find a block that would cause that opening tag to be there and then they can inject their web shell into it they would close the comment

exploiting it was", "start": 5433.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " which is Jesus impacts the gzip aspect actually does make this pretty interesting exploit I think I mean yeah they it was just Brute

of a challenge you designed at some point but I'll get to that later but um yeah like I said earlier this specific attack does require technician access they do say in their final notes that theoretically this can be hit by an attacker without it like a valid account because you can use failed logins because of the logs that they say saved the events table to insert data into the database to trigger the Bob but they say that it's probably not like practically speaking doing that is going to be a lot more difficult because you have less control over the data you don't you also don't have as like you're hitting it blind so it's it's theoretically possible but it might not be practically possible they didn't really explore it so it might be possible to hit from unexploited contacts

interesting Discovery they made when they were testing bugs they discovered last year on the Microsoft RDP client for Mac OS and the issue comes down to how paths are interpreted by Windows especially when it comes to you know forward slashes versus backslashes and it specifically in the windows API functions the paths TCH canonicalization function I hope I said that right and Annika lies out of your tongue twister word but anyway basically what this function does is it tries to take a path string and evaluates it and it converts it into a canonical form and this is used to check the final path against path traversal that's how they used it in these RDP clients", "start": 5771.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " and just to be clear that's something I've even mentioned before is when you want to look to make sure something is annoying sort of path traversal it don't bother looking in the string for like your dot dot slash and try to remove that or trying to fix it up it just get the canonical path and compare that prefect's on it if the prefect's is where you want and obviously make sure it's not going until we get another folder if you don't want it to but usually just the prefect's is fine but that's AB specifically this is definitely something I would tell people to kind of do your canonical path is going to be your it's an absolute path but every file will only have one canonical path so with app just being absolute oh how symlinks and stuff gave you is can vary like there are some places where you could have multiple", "start": 5834.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " paths to the same thing", "start": 5887.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " so bully connection isn't that what everybody do so many times I run two people not doing that we've talked about directory

is that it's not sufficient", "start": 5890.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " they yeah they try to do it right and they failed", "start": 5914.0}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " well it's not I don't think they like whoever wrote the code here like just the cone using this like this is I failed them yeah this is how you should be doing it and it doesn't work you can break it", "start": 5916.3}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " yeah so what's weird is you know Windows is always been kind of contrarian to Unix and that paths like to use the backslashes instead of forwards she has I never understood why because it seems really dumb because backslashes have always been used to escape character so you always have to do a double backslash but anyway even though Windows prefers those they have supported forward slashes for like ever just because you know people like using forward slash paths just because the familiar familiarity with Unix and stuff like that", "start": 5929.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " well and you don't have to do double backslash you know you don't write one", "start": 5963.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " character yeah so the problem is this Windows API function only considers backslash it doesn't consider forward slashes it just ignores them so if you do like a dot dot backslash backslash backslash to try to escape the current directory or go up a directory you know that was considered by the can I can initialize function and it would you know adjust that in the path but dot dot slash was completely ignored so when they went to compare the strings they were equal even though the one string had the path traversal through the dot dot slash so the patch wasn't sufficient so Microsoft just didn't consider that case in the function so obviously the documentation for that when the API function doesn't say anything about that behavior so looking at this code from a Layman's point of view if you don't understand that like work with that function you would think okay this looks fine and I think checkpoint even said originally this function was broken and they fixed it with this code which they then exploited further but when they looked at the patch they said okay looks like this issue is fixed and that was from their blog posts last year and when they looked at it more closely they found it wasn't fixed because of that weird quirk the checkpoint decided to have a little fun when they found this issue they presented their software devs with a challenge to implement the function in Windows that receives a file path and is resilient against path traversal and they found I think they said almost all the implementations that they got use this function the path C CH can and alkalis and they didn't consider the slashes so they could all be broken in the same way so that's part of the reason they put this post out there is even though this just talks about in the context of the RDP clients they figure this issue probably exists in a lot of different applications because of that issue existing in the windows API and the way it's being called is the way that Microsoft you know expects you to call it they I think it's still the recommended function to use to prevent theft reversal so what's kind of weird is when they reported this issue to Microsoft they didn't actually patch the the windows API function that canonical eyes has it they just made it so that they replace all the forward slashes in the RDP client with backslashes before calling the API function so they kind of they fix the issue in the client but they didn't fix the issue in the windows API I don't know why I don't know if there was like some weird Logistics behind that that was", "start": 5967.4}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " well I mean they can't break the API now but I mean somebody somewhere as an application that depends on that difference I don't know what I would be you before but I mean yeah no this is it can mean obviously this itself like it's fixed in the RTP coin so whatever but as an issue like there's absolutely going to be with her code that checks for path traversal in this way and it's you know the recommended best practice is not the best", "start": 6122.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " practice it seems like Microsoft kind of dropped the ball there I think even if you were right and for some reason they couldn't fix the actual API function implementation they should have at least amended the documentation and made it clear that that Quark exists that way you know you know when calling this function and sure to replace backslashes with our forward slashes with backslashes because like it's hard to do that but if you don't know that you don't have to do that then people aren't going to do that though if you couldn't fix the function you should have at least a met at the documentation so I mean Microsoft should get called out for this a little bit because yeah that's not what exactly is going to cause issues and other applications that it's not really their fault so yeah fun fact though I didn't look into it too much but something in this blog post said that they actually used this issue to tape a hyper-v guests through the hyper-v hyper-v manager because I think the hyper-v manager has access to the host paths and you could pull off that path traversal from the guests though usually path traversal is definitely an issue but it's not something you typically consider as like a VM Escape Vector so I thought that was kind of interesting but that's that's kind of a side note more important note is you know that Windows API function doesn't function is expected and hopefully Microsoft you know at least a Mensa documentation to make that more known so yeah I guess this this post isn't just a research post but it's also kind of a PSA I guess not regard but we kind of wanted to make sure we covered that that being said we can move on so we haven't had a named exploit in a very long time see well I've been going

blog so we're going to go into the internals I felt like I could give it to him for that but yeah there's there's actually I think I linked you to a Twitter post that basically summarizes that and I'll just bring it up here but the understanding of the Twitter is create a printer port pointing to a missing dll in a privileged location print to that Port crash the spooler service or reboot and now your original print is written to the dll path as system and ready for dll hijacking it all fits into tweet that's the gist of what's going on for this attack the specifics of it oh go ahead",

to add a printer port that goes to a dll and system32 for example you do get an access denied prompt which makes you think initially okay this you know this is safe you know you can't just create a printer port the points to a dll in a privilege path but what they actually ended up finding when they dug into it was if you add it directly through something like Powershell the port isn't validated the problem is the port validation happens on the UI side of the printer dialog it doesn't happen in the actual component that adds the port so", "start": 6409.6}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " so to be clear some of it so it doesn't happen when it adds support but it will happen when you try and print when you right tuxie check happens when you try and access the printer port so even though you might be able to overwrite a dll with this in a privileged location and add the printer port until you can try and write to it and just to be clear so we're talking about the printer port when you have a printer you've got the printer port and obviously a printer driver drivers can generally be added by anybody as long as it's kind of like a driver that already exists you can like a add a new driver but you can load printer drivers that already exists in the system so your generic / text only printer driver will effectively when you're printing to it if you literally just print a bite to it it prints that bite out so when we're talking about like printing you can literally just print bytes out to a file for your printer port could be a file which I actually didn't know and I had never really looked into it that much like it doesn't surprise me that that it could be especially like this generic one if it were if the port was a network it would just write those bytes out over on the network so you have those two parts so having the printer port you could set it to whatever file you want to kind of write or print too but when you try and print with that's where the access check comes in and obviously in the UI as you mentioned it'll check it then when you try to have but if you use the commands because it only happened because that check only happens on the excess you're able to kind of get around it by creating it and then later you're able to ask like but I'll like you keep talking about it", "start": 6454.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " yeah so like you were saying if you try to access the file or access the printer port you will get an error because they attach a user token to the file access operations so if you try to exploit it it will fail because your user is not really good it's not going to have permissions to write into like system32 for example but where it gets interesting is if you can crash or kill the spooler or reboot the system or anything like that the file access will succeed I'm assuming this is due to it using a I'm token before the user token can be captured so the the default token that it uses before it gets so written has more", "start": 6566.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " privileges I believe I believe what goes on here he kind of talks about the shadow job file that's created to buy the sport kind of track the actual job itself winds up happening is that it doesn't contain as much information as the job actually has so it just doesn't contain the impersonation token so I don't just use system if it ends up rebooting it needs to read that shadow job file while I believe that's what it was I might be mistaken okay like I said it's a beautiful long read and he talks about a few different things that are semi", "start": 6602.8}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " related yeah ultimately that file does end up getting written without that impersonation token and what you end up there what you end up with is not only is the file being written and you're bypassing the access control check it's also persistent because it's on the file system but the other thing is too is because the right isn't being impersonated as the user it's also stealthy because if you go you know if you go into a like system32 for example and you see a dll file there that's written by a user ER that's going to be a pretty suspicious you know what I mean if you're doing forensics or something like that that's that's going to be kind of a red flag but because that impersonation token isn't being used it's writing it as system so it looks like a legitimate dll file that's in there so it's kind of like a two-pronged issue it's not only allowing you to do the Access Control Bypass but it's also take away that trust factor I guess a bit because it's not being impersonated as a user who actually committed the print so we're saying there's a lot of background there it's an interesting issue I think they even said in the blog post this was like one of their top five Windows issues in the history of like looking at Windows stuff what yeah I mean this is for a while so that's kind of a", "start": 6636.2}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " that's definitely want those issues I kind of go and say like it's a fun issue because it's so easy to take advantage of and the issue itself is just like it's logical it's not like anything crazy you know memory corruption or something it's a logical issue you kind of just get a kind of yeah like this is something you could explain to somebody who isn't super technical I mean the dll aspect okay maybe it's like dll hijacking maybe not but then but I feel like the core a she like you kind of explain this one to somebody who isn't super", "start": 6710.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " familiar yeah so overall it's a fun read I will recommend though if you don't care about too much of the windows internals you can just skip down to the bottom of the page to where the actual issue is or you can check out that Twitter post that Z linked as well but yeah it's always fun to look at printer stuff because printers have always been one of those things that haven't really kept up with time the printer spooler service is probably the one of the oldest Services probably still running on windows so it's not too surprising that you find like issues like that in that area but printers are like so weird and how they work and that's why I think they're kind of fun to look at from like an exploitation point of view stuff like that", "start": 6753.8}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " oh no I feel like

not going to go into a discussion about that here because it's pretty off topic but it's awful I hated it I hated life when I had to work with fonts so next we will get into security flaws in Adobe Acrobat Reader so Adobe Acrobat Reader we're talking about Adobe it's not surprising that there's multiple issues in here this blog post details 3 vo/mini-disc realities in the reader for Mac OS",

all be chained together to LPE to root and what makes it more impactful than it otherwise could have been is it seems the updater component of Adobe Acrobat Reader is not sandboxed and this is kind of an important detail because apples sandboxing and both Mac OS and iOS is pretty damned strong precisely for preventing attacks like this apples really good with their defense in depth the fact that this this updater component exists outside of sandboxing is the reason why the article author went after that component so getting into the actual issues the first issue is there updater uses xpc for inter-process communication which is an apple provided IPC mechanism at functions over XML and property list which we've actually talked about a little bit in the past with the Sadducees were I think that was last week and basically what they do there is they do a check on the bundle ID of the client process for authentication problem is there that trust in the bundle ID is kind of misplaced that bundle ID can easily be faked by just you know creating the directory structure yourself though the trust put in that bundle ID is is unfounded and that kind of breaks assumptions that lead to the other issues the second issue is the download folder from the clientbundle directory is moved to a temporary folder which is outside of the user access which is owned by root but if the download folder has a symlink which is basically a symbolic link that's symbolic link is still kept even after its moved to that root protected", "start": 6839.2}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " directory yeah no quickly mention that that temporary directory move basically what's going on there is the are the idea of that is so that moves it somewhere that the user can't write to so that the next issue basically what happened of so that you know as it does any sort of validation stuff the user can't modify so that's why it's moving this temporary download obviously it's doing an update so it's going to be downloading a file to update and the first is she there just kind of be clear basically it ends up being that any application can connect and call the xpc functions or send the messages and pretend to be something that's not not so yeah you can go on into the race condition", "start": 6935.6}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " so the third issue is like it's very common you see it on Windows a lot it's not just on Mac OS for sure and it's a race condition in the validation of the binary file in the temp test folder called hello root and this binary as you can probably guess by the name is ran as root and so this this like binary file is validated to make sure that it's not just malicious binary that was placed there by an attacker but like Z was mentioning because of that second issue because you can control it through the symbolic link you can basically caused a time of check time of use issue you can write the valid file there to make it pass validation and then post validation symlink it to the file that has the malicious content and then you have you can run an arbitrary binary as root 7 oz LP", "start": 6983.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " just one slide in accuracy there's you've already got the same link going out somewhere you control so rather than Sim linking it to the invalid binary you're just replacing the contents of what it's symlink to yeah the symlink already exists you're here you're just changing the content between when it's a valid binary and when it's going to have launched just because you just mentioned putting in new symlink which isn't quite accurate because you can't change that symlink once it's moved into the temp directory but because that's symlink go we're outside that he do have permission to change you can still change the file", "start": 7036.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " itself yeah so essentially recapping the first issue allows any process like Zoom saying to use the xpc and then that facilitates the ability to exploit the second and third issue which is the race condition to modify the contents of the binary that's run as root so this was really cool most of the time when you see LPE write-ups they're generally like one stage this one is three stages and you have like a mixed bag of issues between all of them you have a false assumption which which causes the logic bug and you have the same linking issue and a race condition so it's fun to see those kind of tied together getting into the fix the fixes they just check if the if the folder contains any siblings before validating the binary they use a new function called validate paths so that will check the path of the of the file that they validate and if it's a symlink it will reject it it just won't process it", "start": 7073.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " yeah and on the exploitation note I will add that they do because obviously with race conditions you always want to enable as large of a race window as possible so you want as long of a period as possible between that validate binary call and the launch arm Hammer which is what they call their updater you want as long of a window as possible between that so what they did for that was effectively just trying to flood that xpc service to make it busy while doing the Race to try and create that it then that's all I did I just want to point out they did have something to try and create a longer longer window for themselves there because that is like as is it you know literally if statement in the end to use that isn't a huge window", "start": 7131.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " yeah those those race window extension techniques I think is like the official like or the you know de facto term for it but like extending those race windows in themselves are often really interesting in fact I've seen entire sorry entire conference talks dedicated to just extending race condition Windows because of race conditions can be so unpredictable and unpredictable to something you don't want and exploits generally so yeah that's definitely a good mention there is those are always fun to see because they're generally clever and how they work and they're they're valuable

that right I hope I did and this research is a little bit older it's from March 6th and April 14th for the second part but we figured it's still worth covering because it's almost certainly still relevant today and it's basically looking at Cloud Web application firewalls to eight how different ones perform at preventing common web application attacks so in the first blog post they looked at

good well when we get into the test results it doesn't look promising for Aid of you huh so they ran tests against all the web application firewalls we just talked about and they measured their success rates against different types of attacks so the the AWS laughs with Amazon rules did the poorest out of all of them actually with a few categories like command injection and ssize they were under 5% it was like really low success rate in preventing the attacks and I think their highest was 45% and that was with path traversal which in theory is probably like one of the easiest categories to like mitigate against the Ford and that one did a little bit better but like not much better and then the the asier aw or the Asia where I've actually did the best its lowest number with 71% that was in cross-site script", "start": 7459.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " so so X as your did the best for part of Ryan I've got part two results up here in Google Cloud armor actually I think did the best overall even though SSI a Sher Khan 100 whereas Google Cloud caught 99 on everything else it was either tied or equal so I was kind of mentioning there that I was a little bit it was a little bit surprising a little bit not surprising and they kind of mention it or they do mention at the end of part 1 their conclusion is they were expecting to need a kind of come up with some custom bypasses to start seeing the differences between them enough for them to be just so terrible right off the bat but what's not surprising here is you'll notice for those V actually who can see the video and not just watching the a sure wife has in Brackets ERS decided as does the Google Cloud platform Cloud armor has CRS beside it cloudflare also has the CRS beside it but it's using a difference here I sort of see it CRS is kind of where I'd say it's unsurprising CRS is the matzo care a rule set so that it are like the rule sets of that's coming I believe a wasp was involved with creation of some of those or a lot of it it's the core rule set from not scary so it's been around for I want to say decades but it might have been somewhere in like mid-2000s when it actually started I don't know the actual start date it's had a lot of time to mature it's singing a lot of taxa name to slowly add an improved to it it's been around for a while and that maturity shows in these results by using the latest version you're getting you know these 90% of the attacks being block now on the other hand like this could be overzealous blocking does that mean you could get a hundred percent of you just

open source you can run that yourself and that maturity shows here I think I've been disappointed by the performance of some things other services and for cloudflare they're using an older version of

though what I was going to say there was I think that is a good point to bring up just because when you're talking about like a web app the user experience you would probably have you would want potentially less blocking than overly aggressive blocking like you would rather especially because like you were saying that doesn't even it's not even guaranteed there is an issue that it's going to be able to hit though you don't want to like hurt the user experience so that is a really good point to bring up the most interesting data set I found out of all of the tests they ran were against cloudflare now I know you said they are using an older CRS but what I found weird was actually the inconsistency between categories because when you look at like Asia and Google Cloud platform the numbers are all pretty close like you're looking at like a hundred ninety-seven 83 9999 91 but then when you get the cloudflare you've got like 99% and path traversal and then two percent in SSI like

don't want to run like PHP which was super popular at the time you don't want to run something like that you just but you do want to include pages and kind of have some separation your code in your HTML so you might do an SSI include and there are taxi you can do if you're able to control values being included or if you can inject like the SSI tags into something there's a few different things

happened on Reddit was somebody had called it out as being like Oh well if you don't even know what SSL is because they read that as being SSL not SSI and kind of had their comment about not even

ago put simply and like SSI was still you know injections that are still a thing I've never seen it in like professionally speaking I never saw anybody using it I did I have seen a huge like says as a

value", "start": 7942.5}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " so obviously the test results are like the big thing of the blog post that's like the highlight of it they also talked about some conclusions they came out of testing with though one was that URL encoding affected the performance of web application firewalls across-the-board attacks with encoded URLs where generally more successful which I guess kind of makes sense you know it's just missed and the laughter just not decoding the URL I don't know if that's like a performance trade-off thing or if it's just something that was missed in some of them but you know that that's that's a pretty cool conclusion that came out of it generally I like this kind of research that compares two different Technologies to test the effectiveness I think they offer useful Insight even to non-security people who just want to evaluate like which solution is the best for them it offers some useful insights and conclusions like the one with the URL encoding for example one thing I did want to note about their test though that I found a little bit weird is they have a vast difference in number of test cases ran for each category so path traversal for example they had 9,000 test cases ran where excess only had 300 now you have a very vast difference between some of the categories and how much they were tested so you are going to want to factor that into some of the results because while they ran the same number of tests for each web application firewall and that gauri it shows that some of the groups are going to have inflated numbers with the lower amount of test cases or deflated you know depending on how well they did so it's probably a little bit less accurate than it could have been I don't know why they didn't try to match up the test

what that should look like and there are other protocols I use it other things that use it to assess and one is pretty widely used actually just in a lot of kind of older Tech in the background rather than you know it's but definitely anywhere you have like certificates is almost certainly almost certainly has an ASN one for it so the idea here is mentions fuzzing TLS certificates but what they actually go about doing is building a fuzzer that will take asn.1 as input and output fuzzing info and generate your test space on ASN", "start": 8318.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " yeah so this grammar like the first example they give here like the one you were talking about with the integer the integer to utf-8 string that one is pretty simple but they note that the grammar can get super complex they know that it has like 13 different string types you can add Fields constraints you can have information objects parameterisation templating um you know you can insert that Meme here I heard you like grammar so I gave you grammars that you can use in your grammars but like so they show here like when you have such complex grammars like that it's going to be an interesting Target for fuzzing because of how many different possibilities there are and how many edge cases there could be by extension of that so they show here how they compiled the grammar to Generate random Absa abstract syntax trees to provide for smart fuzzing TLS certs or anything that you asn.1 I guess so this post is more of an early stage type of research post there's no results yet they say that's coming in a

it's still I mean I have kind of preferred it if it was really Swift the post but I still kind of want to call this out anyhow yeah man it's definitely an interesting approach to try", "start": 8473.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " it's something to keep an eye on and it's not something I can never recall really seeing being targeted from a funding perspective before so I", "start": 8502.9}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " mean like certificates are targeted for sure but I going from asn.1", "start": 8509.8}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " to the fuzzing generation that that's the guy haven't seen that that part before so I think we will probably see some interesting results when those get put out there so it might be something we can we can try to cover on the future episode you watch it'll probably happen when we're taking the break so probably have to cover it after we come back from the break or something but you know it's something that that Opti bookmarked will say that so we're going to call cap off the show with a shout-out this was kind of a last-minute addition that I saw right before we started the podcast today and it's the the sea is a the Department of Homeland Security cyber security and infrastructure Security Agency it's a real mouthful easier to just say C is a and the FBI put out this read this article that talks about the top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities and the the list is actually kind of interesting as the bait headline would go the results will shock you in a little bit or at least they shocked", "start": 8515.0}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " me number three will shock you I have no idea that I'm sorry is this", "start": 8574.0}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " what I found kind of weird about it was basically all of the products that CDs were listed for were like products I wouldn't expect that were like Microsoft Office Apache struts", "start": 8579.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " but would not expect office so it looks like this is my first time looking at this and it's like sector mentioned it was and more or less last minute so I'm assuming the very first one like this isn't in like the reverse order like a countdown so I'm assuming office is the most excellent so you're saying you wouldn't have expected that whereas I think it's obvious that stuff like office or is it Dobby in here too like I'd expect those office tools to kind of be compromised because that's part of that comes down you know you fish somebody to open up or social engineer I should say somebody to open up your doc file it's a very easy to get that done and a lot of environment and you can get a lot of access through like a secretary's computer or something like that so it seems to me like some like office would be heavily explain and I constantly hear ring about issues there so I mean I'm not surprised by that but I'm curious why", "start": 8592.2}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " you are I guess part of the reason I'm surprised by it is for one I don't know if this is just a bias from like just me not being like around a business environment super often but office doesn't really it seems to be falling at a favorite little bit and what I mean by that is with the rise of things like the Google cloud like Google Docs and stuff like that it seems like companies are really using Microsoft Office like some of the companies that I've worked at haven't even really used it and so I thought its usage was kind of falling off and the other thing was I would expect that there would be what I expected with top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities were stuff like let's say browser bugs like drive-bys and stuff like that that could easily quickly deliver malware like yes that is technically that is usually used for like more targeted attacks as well but I don't know I just did for some reason I just didn't really expect off this to be on the list as much as it is like one two three four five I think six six of the top 10 were all in office and then you know you had a few in like Adobe you know Flash Player which again is something that isn't really used anymore but it was used a lot in the past so it's probably inflated by that and then like Drupal and stuff like that like I don't know I just expected I guess some more like browser stuff and stuff like that in there but maybe that's just a bias from like that's what I'm interested in maybe yeah", "start": 8653.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " could be a bias from collection information to there's there's a lot of lot of ways it can be can be biased I don't know how they found things but oh no I mean this does mention actually malware specifically so this could be post drop no that wouldn't make sense for it to be post drop", "start": 8744.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " I never even noticed by the way that that's cool I didn't notice that they attached like Associated malware that use those bugs so that's really cool because I was I was thinking it would be cool if we had ante on so we could ask him if he's like seen some of these things but I didn't notice right in there they put Associated malware so that's that's really cool but yeah I don't know who the let's just surprised me but you know I think this list might be interesting to people out there it's also interesting that pretty much all these CDs on this list are from 2017 so these are the top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities in 2016 to 2019 so anything before 2016 isn't in the list I guess it kind of makes sense to 2017 is in the list of most Because unless people are staying up-to-date really often which with something like Microsoft Office probably I don't know how common updating is to like the latest security fixes and stuff so it's probably a lot more likely to be able to hit people with end days and stuff like that which is probably why you see some of the older cves", "start": 8768.7}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " I mean there is Office 365 to kind of make that a little bit easier now yes it drew he mentioned some oh no feel like you're completely ignoring all the corporate targets probably the most obvious way for somebody to compromise in order by a malicious stocks and yeah that's kind of what I was getting at when I said I wasn't too surprised by it but in yeah I do think that is I'm inspector you mentioned that's probably your bicep not being in too many office environments but it's still very very", "start": 8831.9}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " heavily used well if you would be my other question then and this is now I'm wishing Andy was on here again is how often are corporations and like organizations targeted compared to just like everyday people there's most Everyday People if they're not doing office like professional office work or anything like that they're not going to have office installed on their PC if they get an email with a docx file they're probably not even going to be able to open it or if they do it's just going to open and like notepad or something know what I mean like that's why I was kind of wondering is how many how much is now we're targeting corporate entities compared to home", "start": 8862.6}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " users I hope you like corporate I guess I can't really say and you would know more on that unfortunately he isn't on so you have to make do with my speculation I'd say there's a good chance corporations are getting a lot more heavily targeted well there are some things that will just kind of Target at", "start": 8901.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " large that's what I was thinking like try to hit everything possible which corporations might get swept up in that but generally like I wonder how much Corporation specifically are getting targeted by well", "start": 8919.6}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " I would imagine there's well that comes down to whether or not it's a targeted attack or not that said I don't know enough about the stats to make an intelligent speculation there I don't see why they wouldn't and why something wouldn't used the dogs like a druggie kind of mentioned it's one of the easiest ways to compromise an organization is through malicious stocks so like it really doesn't surprise me at all but I don't have stats to back that", "start": 8930.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " up yeah so I guess that was just kind of explaining a little bit why I was a bit surprised but yeah anyway that list is out there you can check it out might be an interesting read for some of you but we just wanted to add that as a shout out because like we said last minute addition and people might find it interesting that being said that's all the topics for today I don't know if you have any any parting notes no poor we'd jump off see ya I don't think I have any really either other than the fact that next week is going to be our last episode until September 14th so that's going to be our you know episode 43 it's going to be the last one for a few months so just keep that in mind that being said all of our past episodes including this one 24 hours from now is going to be on YouTube you can also find it in twitch vod's or on What's that the anchor sometimes I forget the name it's also an anchor all of the links", "start": 8962.0}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " are on their things has nice to kind of links um I guess like a dog does ask what are you guys doing during your summer break vacation projects work question mark they're not staying that that's what we'll be doing", "start": 9014.7}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " probably all three and my case", "start": 9029.6}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " yeah pretty much yeah it's a mixing those sorry go ahead", "start": 9031.4}, {"speaker": 1, "line": " I was just going to say I'm going up north for a little bit up North I'm probably going to be working on projects and more like professional related projects so yeah all three of them for me", "start": 9037.1}, {"speaker": 2, "line": " yeah I'll probably head off hiking somewhere I gave some long-distance hiking so if the Border opens I've still might head up to the Arctic up and Alaska again but that's only if the Border opens I think I can be pretty socially distance distance in the", "start": 9048.3}], "speakers": {"1": "Specter", "2": "zi"}, "offset": "12", "youtube": "W1jMHp4ObgY"}
