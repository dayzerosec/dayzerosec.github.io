Welcome to episode 41 of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me a zi and he's he's keeping me awake helping me fight off the darkness. Yeah.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=28" class="timestamp">00:00:28</a><div class="content"> Sounds like you've had a fun weekend.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=30" class="timestamp">00:00:30</a><div class="content"> Yeah, but a very long night. I don't I don't think I've slept in like 28 hours now so, you know, we're going on a streak. So before we jump into the news, we do want to bring up that we are going to be going on a summer break. We want to announce that early. We don't just want to spray it on you guys, so Our last episode is on the 25th of the month. Yep that matches up and then I believe we're going to be back on the 14th. I'm right on that right see on the date</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=57" class="timestamp">00:00:57</a><div class="content"> of call Timber. Yeah, September 14th emblems the day we agreed</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=61" class="timestamp">00:01:01</a><div class="content"> on. Yeah, so we'll be away for a few months just because we're going to be doing some stuff. I'm going to be going up north for a little bit and my connection up there isn't is not going to be very good. I can promise you that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=74" class="timestamp">00:01:14</a><div class="content"> and people probably don't want to just hear me ramble on. Alone for a while and I don't know. I mean we could do</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=80" class="timestamp">00:01:20</a><div class="content"> a straw poll</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=82" class="timestamp">00:01:22</a><div class="content"> now but I mean it's a did something similar last year. We talked I think a longer break last year though, but</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=93" class="timestamp">00:01:33</a><div class="content"> not too much to do this year. So the shorter break this year. We'll get into that in a minute. I think so part of the reason that I was up so late or basically the only reason I haven't really been sleeping as because we've been On the open orbis PS4 toolchain, so I figured I'd do you know a little plug a little bit of you know, Shameless self-promotion. I guess it hasn't dropped yet, which is why I have a screenshot up on the screen. But the open orbis toolchain is going to be dropping later on today. We've been working on it for over a year. There's been a lot of reversing work and programming and stuff and there's been a collaboration between like lots of people to make it come</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=139" class="timestamp">00:02:19</a><div class="content"> together. So I mean the or anybody that's not familiar with it. What's the purpose</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=144" class="timestamp">00:02:24</a><div class="content"> here? To build PS4 applications games Homebrew because basically to build PS4 applications in the past. You've had to use the Sony SDK, which is obviously it's copyrighted material. It's leaked. You're not supposed to have it. It's technically illegal. So it's not really ideal. You know, people have to get pirated links for the tool chain or for the official SDK and then technically even anything they you know produce what that SDK could technically be be in like, you know legal grey water as well</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=177" class="timestamp">00:02:57</a><div class="content"> on that note has do you know if anybody that's actually been</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=180" class="timestamp">00:03:00</a><div class="content"> prosecuted or using it? No, actually, but</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=188" class="timestamp">00:03:08</a><div class="content"> II mean that's not a reason not like that's not a reason to go and use it like oh nobody's been prosecute. Therefore. It's fine. You generally still want to stay out of using copyrighted material because if Sony were to decide to you don't want to give you an ice cream stand on. Yeah.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=202" class="timestamp">00:03:22</a><div class="content"> Yeah. I mean, it's kind of interesting. I almost feel like Sony is a little bit scared to do it now. I don't know if because they got a lot of PR backlash back in the PS3 days when they tried to sue Go hot. You know what I mean? That case kind of I think I don't know because they haven't really tried to pull anything like that since but you know, maybe that'll change. Who knows though. But yeah, basically it's an open source tool chain all the tools and headers and libraries and everything are completely like our code. There's no Sony has TK code or anything in there. We actually do kind of a cool trick because obviously the PS4 has, you know, its own libraries and we can't Distribute those libraries right? Because they're not ours and we actually do kind of a cool trick there where we make fake libraries and do re-linking after the fact to make it look like we're linking against Real Dynamic libraries, but we're not those kind of its kind of cool how it works. We do some like fun tricks like that to make it work. But yeah people will be able to see how that all works a little bit later on tonight. We wanted to try to get something done in Europe before it drops. That's why it's Mira drops like way early. This morning and this the tool chain is a little bit later. But yeah, we just want to try to get something done in Mira first, but the tool chain will be dropping tonight. So it might be, you know, interesting for some of you out there to check that out and especially if you're interested in consoles and home brew and stuff like that. You know figure we do a little bit of Shameless self promotion of the beginning the episode.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=299" class="timestamp">00:04:59</a><div class="content"> I don't think too much for now. That's fair. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people are here because they know if you threw your PS4 work so, you know, you're not dropping a kernel exploit, but it's something</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=312" class="timestamp">00:05:12</a><div class="content"> nothing's ever good enough. All right, so we can move on to Def con so memes have are no longer dreams this year memes have crossed over into reality. As dark tangent has put it Defcon has been canceled. I mean we all knew this was gonna happen. There was no there was no chance that death comes going to happen this year. It's just too close. So I did want to ask see because there was something you linked to me during the week that I forgot to check out you were saying something about a Defcon Discord thing and I wanted to yeah,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=348" class="timestamp">00:05:48</a><div class="content"> well, so that's actually here on this page. They mentioned here then on August 6 will open the def con Discord dot IO / DC server off for everyone to join and start their work on experience So Def Con in person is canceled. They are going to try and do like more virtual. And so part of that is the is the Discord. But I do think that this court has an interesting idea. I don't know how that's going to turn out given the numbers that the def con will see that could end up being quite the large. Discord server and not really get much discussion out if it'd be just because there's too many people.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=395" class="timestamp">00:06:35</a><div class="content"> So are they using Discord because of that that like video chat kind of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=400" class="timestamp">00:06:40</a><div class="content"> feature. They don't mention that okay, so I have no idea if that's going to be related.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=406" class="timestamp">00:06:46</a><div class="content"> See I was just wondering because Discord seems like kind of an odd Choice especially for something like Defcon defcons always been kind of had that theme of like don't trust anything and discords one of those were I could see some people not wanting to use it just because there's been you know, Rumors forever about logging. I don't know how much I trust those rumors, but you know, there's been rumors about logging and then you obviously you have the rich present stuff which some people aren't super happy with I remember at one point. I don't know if it still does it it would forcefully show if you were on mobile or not at least on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=443" class="timestamp">00:07:23</a><div class="content"> iOS, I believe libros if you're only on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=446" class="timestamp">00:07:26</a><div class="content"> mobile Yeah,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=449" class="timestamp">00:07:29</a><div class="content"> so I mean in terms of long I don't think discords have really claim that they don't log. I mean they definitely don't push themselves as the Privacy Centric option. So yeah, it is a little bit strange for def con at the same time. You know, they're trying to reach kind of the masses like I mean Defcon is not just like a new hacker only convention. I mean most of the people are show up at def con. Are more enthusiastic than anything</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=479" class="timestamp">00:07:59</a><div class="content"> else? Yeah, I just would have expected like IRC or telegram.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=483" class="timestamp">00:08:03</a><div class="content"> Well, so what I was going to say though, is that both of those kind of have their rough edges in terms of being used in general?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=492" class="timestamp">00:08:12</a><div class="content"> Yeah, their usability is a little bit harsh especially like IRC not many people use IRC anymore.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=499" class="timestamp">00:08:19</a><div class="content"> Yeah. So I mean Defcon is probably probably one of the best options they have it. I mean, I understand the concerns about privacy and all that at the same time given the type of person they're trying to appeal to a lot of them are already going to be using Discord in are going to share those same reservations. That's it. I can't imagine they're using it for the streaming because I think there's still a pretty significant limit. Even if you're even if you're like maxed out and it Discord partner. I still think there's a limit on how much it's like. Yeah. It's like it's still well they often will they up there, too? Well for free, I think they opted to like 50, but even so those I mean 50 people like defcons not going to use that to stream. Yeah, that's not enough people when we're talking about a thousand</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=552" class="timestamp">00:09:12</a><div class="content"> people exactly. Yeah. So now there is one other last-minute thing that I saw actually before we started screaming because I had Twitter open in another tab. I remember episodes ago. We were talking about how Defcon Qualls were postponed because As they weren't sure what was going on with the covid situation stuff like that. Yeah and Order of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=574" class="timestamp">00:09:34</a><div class="content"> the Overflow has put out a bit of an update, but you can keep going.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=578" class="timestamp">00:09:38</a><div class="content"> Yeah, so I was going to say order the Overflow has announced there will be a Defcon CTF final because that was one thing we were kind of speculating about is if defcons canceled what's going to happen with the final at the CTF and it seems they are going to be going through with it. They don't know exactly what it's going to look like yet. They're kind of I think they're still trying to work out all the details, but they are going to try to make it work. So it's going to be virtual for sure because there's no other way you could do it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=604" class="timestamp">00:10:04</a><div class="content"> But yeah, it'll be all right police say mentioned exactly that that it would be virtual.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=609" class="timestamp">00:10:09</a><div class="content"> Yeah. They said they're still trying to work out the details and it's cool to see like test the waters and see how well it works out. That means that I don't think it's going to be virtual ever again because it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing and I think generally people want the finals to be local. Although I don't know because some of the people I talked to the Defcon CTF last year were saying or maybe make it easier before but they were saying like they really hated with the def con finals how it's in like a public area and they can't focus it all because there's so much noise</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=640" class="timestamp">00:10:40</a><div class="content"> so I know at least in the past that has been more or less by Design. mmm Having that as part of our challenge. Yeah. Yeah, that's said I thought last year. They had kind of moved the CTF a little bit more out of the way from how it's normally been.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=660" class="timestamp">00:11:00</a><div class="content"> Yeah, that's that's why I was saying two years ago because last year, you're right. I think they had it in Paris or whatever and it was basically that was the only thing in that hotel basically was the CTF and maybe a few other like really small like things. So yeah last year it was The year before though I remember hearing some people that they were like and Folks at all on the CTF floor. Yeah, that's neither here. And I feel like I don't</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=687" class="timestamp">00:11:27</a><div class="content"> know something organizers. Like I feel like Dede Tech mentioned something about that basically being like intentional least for theirs and they were the organizers before legit Pious who did it or before order of the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=702" class="timestamp">00:11:42</a><div class="content"> Overflow. So how many more years is order the Overflow have defcons like a contract with def con? Do you know</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=709" class="timestamp">00:11:49</a><div class="content"> I don't recall how many years I remember when they put out the call for organizers and it had I want to say it had three years on it. But I reckon you're</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=723" class="timestamp">00:12:03</a><div class="content"> right. Their second or third third,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=727" class="timestamp">00:12:07</a><div class="content"> I think so this this might be their last year or might not like I really don't remember. So yes, right. I don't want to come down I saying like it's definitely oh I mean, even if it was the end of their kind of contract I imagined I could still be extended regardless. Yeah, it's just kind of a minimum rather than maximum. Yeah,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=752" class="timestamp">00:12:32</a><div class="content"> overall though. It'll be interesting to see how it goes. Well, we'll keep an eye out for that. Who knows maybe we'll even do like a quick like update stream during our break just if there's something interesting that happens or something, you know,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=764" class="timestamp">00:12:44</a><div class="content"> what is worth mentioning also am in terms of our break there. Yeah, we're going to be going off for you know, the few months. We still May stream during that period we may or may not probably won't be the podcast but just in general streams. And don't say no schedules. Yeah, basically, yeah coming back onto the CTF though. I guess maybe I'm mistaken. I don't see any update actually from order of the Overflow.

So this year has been the year of the leaks. We've had AMD source code leaks we've had csgo source code links. We've had Microsoft leaks and we've had a Nintendo leaks and some of the Nintendo leaks we've seen have been like debug ROMs and stuff like that. But the big thing is apparently the full source code and design specs were leaked for the Wii. And I will say like this stuff is pretty old like the we as pretty old by now, but I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=840" class="timestamp">00:14:00</a><div class="content"> think well, so I don't leave their stuff for the we also for like the GameCube, I believe the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=850" class="timestamp">00:14:10</a><div class="content"> N64 heard yes stuff as well. I think</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=853" class="timestamp">00:14:13</a><div class="content"> yeah, but I mean obviously something notable stuff like you said source code for iOS the Wiis operating system. And obviously all the data sheets very long before the actual console Hardware.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=868" class="timestamp">00:14:28</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and that seems to be because apparently the company that did a lot of the development on the Wii which was brought on apparently their server got hacked. That's how all the files got leaked now. I don't want to say that we endorse leaks or anything like that because legally that probably wouldn't be too smart. I will say though that it is kind of cool that you can take a look at the source code. Outdated console especially one like the we just because the we was way ahead of its time man. It was a really cool console and I think it'd be really neat to check out the source and design specs of that. So I wonder how like aggressively Nintendo is going after leaks because Nintendo is</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=914" class="timestamp">00:15:14</a><div class="content"> really happy and trying to take down some of these already.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=918" class="timestamp">00:15:18</a><div class="content"> Yeah, Nintendo's usually pretty pretty heavy on the gas pedal when it comes to leaks and stuff like that. They don't tolerate it at all at the same time though. Like there's part of me though that wants to go out and try to find it just because you know, the we was just such a cool console and I imagine you can find some really interesting stuff in there you go probably find some</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=938" class="timestamp">00:15:38</a><div class="content"> interesting stuff. But at the same time you can to do a lot with it. It'll give you an understanding of the console of course, but it's not like you can go and use this code to you know, work</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=950" class="timestamp">00:15:50</a><div class="content"> on emulator or whatever</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=951" class="timestamp">00:15:51</a><div class="content"> emulator kind of being the most obvious use case, I think but as soon as you started using anything from this if it comes copyright</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=958" class="timestamp">00:15:58</a><div class="content"> issue. Yeah, and well, not only that. I think it's got a similar issue to the AMD leaks when you have like this the Vera log and stuff like that while technically speaking you should be able to like emulate the hardware and stuff like that. I think like with the AMD case you needed like tens of thousands of dollars worth of hardware. And then even then it was like a hundred times slower than the native Hardware so you probably can't do anything super useful with this stuff. But I just think it's like really Cool to be able to look at it which makes it kind of sucks that it's a leak, right? Because it's technically you know, it is piracy if you if you download it, so, you know got to kind of fight that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1003" class="timestamp">00:16:43</a><div class="content"> urge.

No, probably not there that expensive. But yeah, so, you know those leaks happened. I can only wonder what's next this year. We've seen so many things Sleek now, what is notable is I think these leaks are a little bit old like I think Leaks were circulating around and private circles for a little while, which is also true at some of the other leaks. We've seen this year the csgo one. For example without was like a 20-18 source code leak so</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1061" class="timestamp">00:17:41</a><div class="content"> and this one so I'm not I wasn't able to actually confirm this but I did see some speculation of it actually being related to some that happened in</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1069" class="timestamp">00:17:49</a><div class="content"> 2017.

With stone you can get but that also seems a little bit weird to me. So I'm just tossing it out there. I'm not saying that's what happened</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1096" class="timestamp">00:18:16</a><div class="content"> at all. I do kind of wonder what's prompting all of these leaks all of a sudden especially considering like at least two of the major ones are like old they're not they didn't happen this year. But I wonder if there's just like a, you know, an our Revolution happening. I don't know. I don't know why there's so many leaks coming out especially like Generally, like all them have been within the last month. So it's been been pretty weird. But you know, I guess yeah, I can't really</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1125" class="timestamp">00:18:45</a><div class="content"> speculate on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1125" class="timestamp">00:18:45</a><div class="content"> motivations. Yeah, so he base and zoom we talked a lot about zoom on this podcast not in a particularly positive context and what we found out last week was Zoom acquired key base. So we wanted to bring this up not only because we've talked about Zoom but also because key base I'd say It's safe to say it's fairly popular in this industry just because of the service it provides. You know, I used to use it. I don't use it anymore mainly because the client is just not</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1160" class="timestamp">00:19:20</a><div class="content"> good.

It's like okay Zoom has been getting hit by security issues recently. So this almost feels like it's just more of a publicity stunt than anything else. I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1187" class="timestamp">00:19:47</a><div class="content"> was thinking the same thing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1188" class="timestamp">00:19:48</a><div class="content"> because I mean why like key base? Doesn't really have like some secret sauce or something, you know special security technology. Like I mean, they use crypto. It's not it's not something secret. It's not something that Zoom couldn't also do already and that they definitely need to know basically by okey base to work on zoo. Now that said they do mention like yeah, the teabags team will be working on improving the security</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1222" class="timestamp">00:20:22</a><div class="content"> of zoo.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1224" class="timestamp">00:20:24</a><div class="content"> Bring on some of those things.

Yeah now related to what you were saying. I actually found like a pretty funny quote. I think it was in the in the other article that they link but they said we are committed to remaining transparent and open as we build our end-to-end encryption offering we plan to publish a detailed draft cryptographic design on Friday, May 22nd. So, I mean I'm pretty sure we've went through zooms and they're like piping up their end-to-end encryption before even though it wasn't actually end-to-end encryption.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1283" class="timestamp">00:21:23</a><div class="content"> At least in this case. I'd say the key base understands what end-to-end encryption is, whereas with zoom it seemed like, you know, they were saying, okay. Well, there's TLS there's encryption to the server. There's encryption from the server. Therefore end-to-end. Just somebody marketing or otherwise just didn't</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1299" class="timestamp">00:21:39</a><div class="content"> understand what end-to-end encryption.

Yeah, but what's interesting about it is like we just got the like crypto, you know design or the You remember that post they did where they tried to give like an overview of how the crypto Works in zoom and it was just like really vague and easy to follow.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1324" class="timestamp">00:22:04</a><div class="content"> No, I don't. So what I remember is when we were talking about Zoom. I had brought up what was on their homepage and that was also brought up by one that he will talk about the if she's one of the write-ups we did where they chose the comments be elf their home page where they talk about. Okay, we have like a s, you know 256 and they were using one 28 or whatever like some of the claims that they made but I don't believe zooms ever published any sort of white paper on their crypto.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1355" class="timestamp">00:22:35</a><div class="content"> I could I don't think they did a white paper. I think they did a short blog post saying here. We'd like to clear up some confusion about, you know our system just because of the negative PR they were getting but anyway, I find it interesting that they are doing like that design draft and that's that's coming out on May 22nd. So we'll be able to talk about that on this podcast. The follow-up at least we should be able to write that's yeah. Yeah will be hopeful and on the 25th. Yeah. I was also there and I have four</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1385" class="timestamp">00:23:05</a><div class="content"> there is this page out there support from Zoom where they talk about their encryption.

Yeah,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1414" class="timestamp">00:23:34</a><div class="content"> I'll have to go back and try to find what I was angry because it was a few episodes back like it was it was probably like at least three or four episodes back. So I'll try to go back and look for it and bring it up and maybe do like a little addendum</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1426" class="timestamp">00:23:46</a><div class="content"> next or add a link in the description.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1429" class="timestamp">00:23:49</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I can do that as well. Overall, I mean do you think this move is is positive in any way for either Zoom or key base or do you sure I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1442" class="timestamp">00:24:02</a><div class="content"> mean if Zoom security increases because of that is a net positive for key base. Unfortunately, I think this means what's going to happen. Is that key base? I don't think they're going to shut down key base. It's just there's not going to be any further development or minimal further development on it. So it's purely speculation on my part like I don't Zoom. Like Zoom isn't going to want to cannibalize their own platform and get people using key base. They're going to want to integrate key base with</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1470" class="timestamp">00:24:30</a><div class="content"> zoom. Yeah, and so no real way to monetize key base either this point like there's just</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1478" class="timestamp">00:24:38</a><div class="content"> yeah, so I could see them leaving it kind of as is and starting to integrate more things into Zoom, which I think will be a net positive for them. Like I don't have too many questions about whether or not the key base team is capable of writing some proper crypto</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1497" class="timestamp">00:24:57</a><div class="content"> code. Yeah, I guess part of what my thought process is. I wonder if we're going to start seeing more and more people stopped using key based just because its affiliated with zoom at all. You know what I mean? There's been so</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1510" class="timestamp">00:25:10</a><div class="content"> much you're going to have people who don't like the Chinese Association plain and simple.

Awesome. Yeah. I mean like you were saying key base was already kind of on its way out, but I think you know being affiliated with zoom is probably gonna push it out even faster. I think people you know, especially because a lot of people use key baits are using it because they want that privacy and security aspect. You know what I mean? And when you start affiliating with a company like Zoom, even if you ignore the Chinese, you know weird ties going on there also have you know, all the all the pr they've gotten for the stupid crypto issues that they've had which like you said the key base team is more competent, but just that affiliation, you know, it's kind of like that. It kind of like infects the brand I guess. People just don't want to affiliate with it anymore.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1584" class="timestamp">00:26:24</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I can see that happening personally. I mean, like I said, I think it's going to be a positive for Zoo. And it very well may drive more of zooms client face into key base or at least into using some of the more crypto based features. Like if they start making that more standard</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1607" class="timestamp">00:26:47</a><div class="content"> Let me know well honest like I think Devil's Advocate it would be really cool.

I just I can't I can't use the client. So</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1626" class="timestamp">00:27:06</a><div class="content"> yeah, and I don't think that's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1628" class="timestamp">00:27:08</a><div class="content"> going to happen on that purse. I mean probably not but it you know, it's possible so we can keep an optimistic Outlook. That's my thought process he pauses. Anyway, did you have something else to add there because I know I know no not really. Okay, so we'll get back into even more leaks. So everyone listening to the podcast has probably heard about this. It was the Microsoft GitHub account getting hacked allegedly over 500 gigs of data from private GitHub repos were, you know leaked from the GitHub account? Now from Microsoft's GitHub account there. Yeah from their organization account. so the private repos were compromised now from what I know it is worth noting that I don't think there's anything in there private repos that's really earth-shattering it's not like they have Windows kernel source code just sitting in a private repo on GitHub from what I know a lot of the stuff that was private on there is just stuff that there was one or two people working on or it was stuff that was meant to go public at some point anyway</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1694" class="timestamp">00:28:14</a><div class="content"> yeah well that's what it seems like the official statements been is that the stuff on the GitHub is generally stuff that's was going to be going public if it wasn't already</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1704" class="timestamp">00:28:24</a><div class="content"> public Yeah, which still sucks for Microsoft? You know what? I mean? You want to have that like release, you know what I mean, like thinking about like going back to the tool chain, like it would suck on somebody like the tool chain before I wanted to release it, but it's not as serious as it could have been basically.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=1721" class="timestamp">00:28:41</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I mean at the same time. Even if somebody were to let's say there was some good project in there that you know for whatever reason was on their GitHub just private. even if somebody release that I don't think it would really kind of steal the steam from Microsoft because nobody's going to use it until Microsoft releases it it just won't be considered production-ready and Microsoft generally like you want something production-ready and Elite just isn't that The only thing I'd really be concerned about is you know, perhaps if there had been any sort of API Keys either actually like presently committed or in the history of the commits.

They already think it all the private repos. It's not everybody's private repo. That's it here though.

So the research challenge with so obviously Azure has their bug Bounty program this kind of like a subpart and actually just taking out chat Drew he mentions it didn't look like it contained The Crown Jewel seems more like miscellaneous projects cross company. And yeah, it's basically it seems like the GitHub was being used for projects that would likely go public soon or very small projects just they needed something really quick didn't want to use like an internal repo for it like a couple people working on something type deal.

Its we sometimes will cover some new bounties coming out. So this is one as your sphere. Is basically Microsoft's attempt at increasing iot security. We've talked a number of times about kind of bad iot security. So what as your sphere is it is a iot device. So Hardware, well, it's a it's a coyote security solution is what they call it involves Hardware. They've got their own custom silicon custom operating system called sphere OS which is based on Linux and it has Cloud component the Service, which runs in the Azure Cloud what they've opened up with their bound. Here's the Azure Bounty. I'll says of research challenge which generally just higher payments for targeting a specific. Component or like some sort something specific. They'll have a challenge for the research we've done in a deadline for it. So this challenge is running from June 1st through August 31st, and it's focused on I have to reopen the window. Sorry its focus on its focus on the Azure sphere stuff. So in particular ability to execute code on pluton is $100,000 pluton. Is there root of trust?

I mean right now, you know what I mean, if you if you're looking for like a lucrative Bounty while you're you know, not working because of the covid stuff or anything like that. This is this is probably an area that is worth looking at and like Drew you was saying and chat mediatheque. Yeah media texts pretty terrible. You can probably find some stuff in there though.

So this post seems to be a myriad of issues that just compound to allow hijacking routers. It seems there was like three major issues no access control on admin functionality. They had no see surf protection apparently and because of that they were able to just disable the admin password on the admin panel setup page.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=2596" class="timestamp">00:43:16</a><div class="content"> Yeah, that's the gist of it. Basically you could make a post request to the advanced setup underscore admin dot CGI page and just said Edmund PWC a 2-0 in that request and that would disable the admin password at which point you can do whatever you want. And I mean that just comes down to well. I think the biggest thing there is a lot insufficient Access Control.

I would know I did want to drop it and then I figured we wouldn't because I ended up dropping the other hacker one because it was even worse. I had another vulnerability that we are going to talk about that was even less interested. I mean, so this one isn't it's not that it's terribly uninteresting effectively. All that's happened here. And the reason why was going to drop his because well, they paid out a bounty for this issue. I think 560 dollar Bounty. They will not pale bounties for this issue going forward. So that's why I was going to drop this one because it was deemed as just being out of scope and it's essentially a sort of denial service against Twitter basically coming by sending it more information and expects to receive which ends up in some way basically eating up enough CPU or hanging one of the applications.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=2869" class="timestamp">00:47:49</a><div class="content"> Yeah, just resource starving it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=2871" class="timestamp">00:47:51</a><div class="content"> Yeah.

I paid him up before making it out of scope. But now these times these types of issues with Twitter. They're not going to get you nothing. So basically moral of the story don't don't bother with DOs. It's just it's not</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3070" class="timestamp">00:51:10</a><div class="content"> or Nostradamus is still there issue that will get paid out on well, so I guess this does actually mention that if she's there that result in denial, sir service to Twitter servers at the network or application layer are now out of scope for Report, so I guess they won't pay out on Doss at all. But I mean it's still worth looking at those types of issues other places do but in particular this one. Yeah, I mean, it's basically you're sending a large payload classic classic test</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3105" class="timestamp">00:51:45</a><div class="content"> case. Yeah, we're getting into some more interesting issues. We have a tale of for both error message messages and a JWT token though. This one was pretty interesting. This person was basically testing using the authorized extension for burp suite and found that they were hitting HTTP 500 errors, but the responses were like really large. I think they said they were like almost like 10</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3135" class="timestamp">00:52:15</a><div class="content"> kilobytes. Yes. So let me mention here that the authorized extension doesn't really matter too much for this. All it does is it would send when you made a request through the burp proxy if you're not familiar with birth, it's a web proxy that's often used for doing like what pain tests where basically you can intercept you can modify the traffic. It has some other things built into it for testing. It's a test Suite Essentially, so the authorized extension will any request that comes through it'll make the request using another set of cookie. So swap out the cookies and don't make a request without the cookies that same endpoint to that way. You just have automated testing one making sure other users can to access like cross user horizontal authentication bypasses. And also just not having any authentication makes Make sure those pages won't be accessible in that case. Also just automatic testing of that. Go ahead Specter.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3195" class="timestamp">00:53:15</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, they hit those 500 errors and found the responses were really large which is pretty abnormal most of the time when you get error Pages like that. It's basically just the error code and that's it. Well, it's so you do see</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3211" class="timestamp">00:53:31</a><div class="content"> I mean, yeah the large. I mean you could have a large error page I mean the error page can YouTube for example dumps a pretty large blob of basics for data your page which isn't all that unexpected it's unexpected in this case just because the other are pointed don't do that the one in particular did so what's actually kind of important here also is as I mentioned it's a tale of a verbose error message and JWT token so what is important is during the testing while testing this application we're not told what the application is just to be clear as we're just talking about an application that's because we're not extolled what it is just it's similar to get Hub in the fact that you could create kind of public and private repositories or projects not actually repository sir you can collaborate one of the features was the ability to duplicate a project so you have whatever project and this one the reason why that feature stood out to this test or is because it required a JWT so Json web token which we've talked about issues with before that unlike most of the application gives the cookies that we were just talking about before and there were a couple features or three features that need these JWT tokens for some reason and that was duplicating the project downloading a project as a zip and writing files to the project What he found was that the unauthenticated request to this duplicated project. So if you were theft has another user you didn't get this but you got an HTTP 500 response when you try to duplicate a project without any of the cookies and without it the JWT. A specter was just getting on that one in particular was much longer than any of the other responses. And if we actually take a look at the screenshot. From a hill kind of notice that you get or at least this is what I noticed from it the response there. It's a Json blob and has an error as the kind of main entry and then you've got another object. I nested in there which has a message containing full HTML in it. Including what looks to be a at least I thought it looked like a stack trace a little looking at it right now. I'm actually not seeing that but what you do notice is you've got this full HTML page in there and you've got a bunch of headers in there also. So what I think's going on here to have an application that would authenticate with another server. So you'd hit this endpoint this duplicate project or whatever you'd hit that end point and it would proxy the requests over to another server. I mean it would pass that j-dub Tito and term to do the authorization and then this case it wasn't expecting to handle any sort of are so gets a 500 like I don't know what to do with this. Let's just dump everything back to the client, which is generally bad practice. You want to handle you want to handle your messages basically give a minimal amount of information. So what's interesting in this is you basically get to see some of the headers that get added by that proxy which ends up including private crafts its own token. If you don't provide one, which is kind of the core of the issue here make crafts its own token, which they refer to as it's basically a god token. Although it doesn't sound like it's actually a god token. It sounds what they determined was that if you made this request to duplicate a project without authentication, it would generate a new user and issue a token to that user with privileges to whatever project you're trying to duplicate. The endpoint would are out for whatever reason that they did know, but that token could then because it got exposed here because the air could be used on other. Request and would give you access to whatever project that token was created for. It's a very roundabout way of saying making this request result in error. That was that contain too much information expose the JWT that was valid for our that would be valid for whatever project you</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3487" class="timestamp">00:58:07</a><div class="content"> wanted. Yeah, so, I mean that's the interesting part right is you can use the tokens to both download projects a zip files and write into projects.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3500" class="timestamp">00:58:20</a><div class="content"> Yeah. So like the JWT probably just has the grant for Like just for the project itself. It doesn't do the granular permissions over you can duplicate or you can edit or you can write it's probably just the data week. You probably just includes that grant for the one the project</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3518" class="timestamp">00:58:38</a><div class="content"> itself. Yeah, now I remember that. This is kind of limited by the fact that the projects are given unique uids. So you have to have a unique uid of a project you want to hit so you know there is that bit of a limiting factor on it. I think in this article though, they even argue they put a made the uuid even stronger to try to prevent hitting the system issue. Obviously you would just want to patch out the issue. but I think they mentioned here that you know if they had a stronger uuid system that it might have been you know less easy to hit basically yeah well</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3561" class="timestamp">00:59:21</a><div class="content"> so you do need to be like Sydney be able to predict what's that what that uid is or what the I guess what the project ideas but the uuid I don't know if how predictable this one is like I don't know if that's a case suet or something which then as maybe a little bit less predictable day if all of That Is Random I don't think it's mentioned in here either. Nonetheless. It is it is recommended when you have public IDs not to use just a single incrementing number but to use a uuid for it. That is just half a generally accepted best practice. Now internally, you could still use just an integer ID. But what you want exposed to a user are those more randomize harder to predict ID values?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3614" class="timestamp">01:00:14</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I think they even have at the bottom.

And it has an SSH Daemon on it that SSH Daemon does use the force command directive in order to force it. When when you login I'll execute whatever the force command is. It's not going to like you just XU here bash shell or whatever. So it executes this mCP package wrap command. And that command effectively just ends up looking here. I pulled up on shrink for those of you watching if the SSH original command starts with SCP. It'll just evaluate whatever the original command was. So it seems like that's basically to like you SCP off the router fairly easily. The problem is as you can see it just looks for the string to start with S. EP it doesn't care. What else comes In that string just if it starts with S EP so there's a pretty obvious injection there. Actually, it's brought up right Stark SCP pipe ID or pie pie pie D. So or ID and it'll execute the idea also in addition to SCP it starts with it so passes, but you get command injection because it doesn't care what comes next. It does all need to be one command. You can just send me: o defect, but other than that you can do what you want and they do go on to use this to gain root privileges in not a terribly interesting way. They look for a suicide binary in this case. They find one. This would be X keep that just calls cat on a file name provided solely to like you read a file as root. It doesn't do like user bin. Cat or anything. It just uses cat so you can set your own path and replace what binary gets executed as route to read the file name. Yeah. I do watch think the force command one kind of the first code injection is kind of interesting the set are the Seward binary is par for the course.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3817" class="timestamp">01:03:37</a><div class="content"> Yeah.

And the funny thing about that is they're kind of diametrically opposed. Usually if you're leaking memory, you're not freeing memory aggressively to have uafs as well. It's kind of, you know two different ways, but they're talking about memory leak in terms of the information disclosure, which is obviously a lot more powerful for exploitation. It's just not as fun when you're when you're talking about, you know, a memory leak fighting a use after free instead of an info disclosure fighting use after free. so I didn't manage to dig into this one too much because I was trying to figure out what they were talking about the input lag here it seems like they just kind of discovered it by accident it didn't seem like they were really looking for it they just sent a proxy authentication or they got a proxy authentication required status code and they just saw like it's suspicious-looking nonsan there and then when they looked at it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=3951" class="timestamp">01:05:51</a><div class="content"> it's ESO dresses they might not have been specifically looking for that issue that said they were obviously looking at squid and just that was something they noticed kind of pretty quickly was that that and on seems a little bit weird so let's back up a little bit the information disclosure is in digestive nth equation so as I was kind of mention here squid is kind of a proxy system that you can use on it's quite quite customizable you can do quite a bit with it but just kind of imagined as being like a proxy server so you can set it up to require authentication and if you're familiar with HTTP authentication methods one of the officers that he can do for this is using kind of digest authentication which you might be familiar in some cases you can set this up in different ways but if you visit a website that just have like the browser little pop-up box that's for the username and password that's probably using Digest it's actually just sending the username and password in like basic C4 I think is the default but one of the options Digest and what that is is effectively with digest sentation you create a hash of the username the password the realm the realm was just kind of value for where the page type deal doesn't really matter in this case all that matters is the authentication you create a hash that of the user password and that you create a hash of the location then he has both of those together with a non sibel you and that way you only send that last hash to the server so the server I need to know your username or password it only needs to know the one hash that's created with your username realm and password so the password never gets sent in clear text in theory the server never needs to know the password I don't want to dive into that whole discussion but Ted it doesn't know the password but your password just becomes that hash like and the server needs to know what so it can't store that hash securely so in my opinion it's worse but either way people have used this what's important there is that server generate not so you have the two hashes you put a nonce between them and you take the hash of that the server needs to send you the nonce which you'll see here it sends this proxy authenticate gives you the realm value gives you the nonce value gives you the quality of protection some other Flakes and their the nonce value so when they looked into how this nonce was generated what they found is and this is the first CD that they found the not just kind of looked a little bit suspicious the values in it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=4124" class="timestamp">01:08:44</a><div class="content"> seemed odd</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=4127" class="timestamp">01:08:47</a><div class="content"> just because a similarity over time that kind of just looks like a memory address in there so what they end up finding here was that the way the nonce was generated and it's kind of the noon on structure that they create and inside of that it has a pointer to itself so kind of new nonsense nonsense dad. Self is just a pointer right back to its parent object and when it's generating the nonce to actually send out all it does is basically a base64 encoding of whatever binary data is in that object or in the knots data part of that object so since it includes the self and gives that as the dawn see basically get</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

didn't or wasn't sufficient and you can kind of imagine why as I was mentioning there's someone knowing data in the nonce itself so one of the fields of the nonce is the creation time you're going to know that as an attacker because you make the request so you're going to know when</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=4296" class="timestamp">01:11:36</a><div class="content"> what that creation time is so it's not down to the milliseconds which wasn't although even if it was that's just a thousand possibilities and the other one though was that did include some random data from the mersenne Twister random number generator now this part of the issue actually reminds me of an issue Facebook had where Facebook session tokens were broken by in a very similar way so what goes on with the Twister RNG is they get seated by time kind of went squid those it's very first request coming through it'll see that just with the time and then it's number of knots it generates each time you request a new random number generator just have increments a counter by one as it goes through the entire state of the RNG so if you know the number of knots that have been generated or the number of times it's been called number of bytes read out from it and you know the time that it started you're able to predict what the RNG will open next so they were able to take advantage of that if you can cause the server to crash or otherwise know that know the value of when of the time at which the server restarted you can as I mentioned you can predict the RNG so then you know the value of the orangey you know the creation time so then the only unique value in that hash is the pointer so you can Brew Force the pointer to still leak at so the hash just didn't work and as I was mentioning about Facebook is I believe quite a while back I want to say like 2008-2009 somewhere in there I think maybe a little bit later I don't think it will be much later than that Facebook's use kind of the default setting for PHP okay and which were basically dealt with in the exact same way so if you were able to crash or just waited for Facebook to crash or restart you are able to predict all the session token it's coming out and login as other users because of that makes sense that said so in this case they do need to crash the server to actually abuse this attack they mentioned and there's a lot of ways you could do that I mean one my favorite would be the tow truck attaches drive a tow truck into it but they didn't go that route and that's what expensive yeah well expensive for the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter"

as that hits zero and go hand free it 16-bit is little bit small so basically every time you it increments every time you get in your requests coming in decrements when the request completed but since it's kind of small you can basically we make enough requests to overflow the counter before the user request object gets garbage collected leading to a use after free because they'd all get garbage collected before the owner object does so the owner object will try and delete it and Away you go with the crash so that's how they were able to get the crash so that they could abuse the excellent so

like userland and stuff like that but this is just one example of why for reference counts you always want to use a size t or like a 64-bit type because overflow like even if there is a theoretical overflow on the ref count overflowing the 64-bit ref count is damn hard it's basically impossible to do in practice so it's one of those kind of defense-in-depth things so yeah you still have above you could technically overflow the ref count but if you have the ref count set at a size that's you know large enough it's you're not really going to get hit with it in practice and this is kind of a good example of that if this was anything if this was like a even a 32-bit ref count might not have been able to get away with</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi"

so this was a Windows kernel bug and it was found in okay not really a huge surprise when 32k is kind of the the Achilles heel of windows so the they go down they break down a lot of the background to likes all the functions involved if you're not too familiar with Windows stuff it might you know confuse you a little bit because you know it is using the windows API and everything but it seemed like the issue basically boiled down to a function being mislabeled they had a function called Microsoft Telemetry is triggered no KR X km it's like the longest function name ever and you know it has a certain the name you would you would figure it would throw an exception or it would you know terminate the process if an assertion failed it turns out it was just mislabeled it wasn't actually in</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=4803" class="timestamp">01:20:03</a><div class="content"> assert I don't know if I'll say it was mislabeled so it's Microsoft Telemetry assert triggered no Arts Camp so that could be that it's Microsoft Telemetry I served was triggered so laughter and assertive which trigger not actually triggering the assert itself and no warrick's cam so like I could understand why this is named I won't say just mislabeled that said the issue it could have been a murder the issues pretty straightforward here because you have some jumping back just a little bit in this particular function that's vulnerable the NT user resolve desktop for a while which is called from zuerlein implementing Colonel it's a syscall user lad rapper it takes a in and out parameter just a pointer that's going to get the value or the return value placed into it it does some checks on the validity of the data it checks of course at the pointer is to use their line data because you don't want the colonel you don't want to be able to use that to tell the colonel to overwrite Something in the kernel of course it checks all the copies all the fields into local kernel memory and checks that the length is less than the max length honestly again making sure that you're not going to overflow any buffers and that the buffer itself exists entirely within user line so you can't like give it a big number and get a to go into Colonel area or overflow whatever so the issue here just kind of giving you that background it's my matter for the actual exploit the issue is that it does this one check that was added in early on it just goes and checks if the length and 100 and so it's on its way well yeah checking if it's odd because the length should always be even for they do explain why that's the case right you know coach sir it's always two bites every characters at least the two bites so you can't have an odd length string so just checks that simple check calls that assert presumably thinking that it is an assert and not just as Telemetry call or whatever and then in the else of that is where performs all these checks like the maximum length checked so what ends up happening though is because Microsoft element forget does return it's not an assert it returns so you basically if you send it the odd sized buffer or the outside size</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=4965"

kind of maybe see where this is going given by what I mentioned earlier where you know there's that concern about copying in and out of Kernel memory you can actually race this you pass in an appropriate Unicode string that it'll accept the kernel verifies that the buffer is safe and then the user line modifies it before the kernel actually ends up using the unfair before the colonel copies in all the checks because gain it doesn't do all of those checks oh so when you give us a lot size length it's going to skip all the checks and then the colonel land sorry I have kind of confused myself</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=5029" class="timestamp">01:23:49</a><div class="content"> here yeah I know I was a little bit confused on that to the way they were talking about doing like the the time of check time of use between the userland and kernel buffers you know it's just probably because of my lack of experience with Windows</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=5043" class="timestamp">01:24:03</a><div class="content"> honestly well so it seems to me that effectively you're sending it in its going to check that length and then just going to carry on with call in the colonel and that's where I've kind of confused myself here because what I've got written down is basically Colonel verifies the buffer safe use a lot modifies the buffer kernel-mode</div></div><div class="line"><div

happening for there to be that period for the colonel to verify because it's not just skipping them which is what it makes it seem like it's just skipping it like that it's just inside of this else

what my issue here is sorry they talk about the talk to but they're not talking about that is how they actually went to exploit it they were using that as just a example of kind of the type of issue that this is trying to prevent the actual issue is as we were saying they're the vulnerability here is you know after this November 20 19 update which adds this check if the length is odd the execution will just continue and all the checks are skipped that's just that is how it is I wrote down the talk to issue because they do just explain what the sir kind of check time of use issue is but they're using that here we go and the code there they're using that just has the following scenario using that as an example of how this could be</div></div><div class="line"><div

say that is I'm pretty sure Windows kernel now at least a lot of it is has CFI now I think Windows kernel is getting stronger in trying to prevent post exploitation or you know exploitation post memory corruption so it would be it would be cool to see how you could get around those mitigations but obviously that's not in the that's not on the post they don't weaponize it but that would be kind of cool to see if you could get around like CFI and stuff like that or if CFI even if x is area I don't even know</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

haven't ridden into all foam and there's some concerns over but jumping back about what was actually getting fuzzed just takes me a while to scroll up through all that is that there's this Sky ischia sk-ii a library that's used to load and display images through various kind of standard apis and that could be used know obviously to do images that are displayed like as part of the APK itself or as part of a okay but that will also include images from untrusted sources so like MMS messages chat applications emails web browser Gallery app whatever well using Curtis well exactly seems like a perfect Target so that's what they start fuzzing and looking at and they in particular I think they focused on these qm + RQ M GQ manage images which I'm actually not terribly familiar with it all but that's mostly what they are fuzzing was this one particular type of image that I had never heard of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

it goes into some detail about how the fuzzing was done like using lib dislocate or instead of just the standard Bella which just adds guards around the allocation so you can detect the Heat Big silver writes a lot easier or overflows anyway getting into what was actually found here though they have a breakdown of the crashes being that they have so the majority of the crash that they had were in what they refer to as just a read one byte and they talked about kind of how they classified all of these so they have like 3 1 2 4 8 16 32 here generally reading up two different sized words

only one bite is actually being read there that might not be to explain about that said more likely I would imagine that exists inside of a loop that just kind of iterating over what he thinks is a string and kind of keeps going go into out-of-bounds memory so just happens to crash on the one bite at least that would be my guess on it so there's a good chance that some of these are still

really needs at a bounds I wonder how many of them are in like Heap allocated data and how many of them are in stack allocated buffers because the reason I say that is I want to say like read ones or the read - ones over to however you want to say on the Heap are going to be probably easier to exploit than the ones on the stack what's so they don't really give any amount of the control you have over the Heap especially in Colonel like</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=5685" class="timestamp">01:34:45</a><div

the attacker had over it it's just it died on this it could be after use after free for example that result in that it could be as you're saying or as I've been saying like the loop So reading over

twos and the reason I say that is the way they caught these crashes right is through the sand right address sanitizer and the way address sanitizer recognizes out of bounds rights is it places red zones right so anywhere that is not inbound to the buffer is marked as a red zone and if a write or read happens there that triggers a crash right that's how ASN a saint squee does it now typically with like 1 &amp; 2 by trites those are so small that they usually don't hit a Red Zone usually like out of bounds rights by only like 1 to 4 bytes or even sometimes one to eight bytes just don't hit a red zone and they don't get detected so I do find it interesting that they manage to find so many that were just like one bite out or something like that yeah I wanna kind of interesting well that's

anyway might be worth checking out still for people who are interested in that but yeah we'll keep it rolling on the Kernel topic and Will Will Roll right into Linux so we have a Linux few texts virtual file system use after free so this one is quite complex and I mean complex even as far as kernel bugs go it's a bug reported by Jan horn and Jen horn he's like a really really smart guy he's like really into Linux it's kind of like the the Ian fear of Linux if you know who that is from Apple stuff and the bug seems to be in the get few text key function which holds a reference to an inode but for some reason he couldn't even really figure out exactly why but it seemed if you didn't hold a mount Point reference or if you had a callback in the superblocks of superblock Destruction code that I knowed can end up getting torn down while it's being used and obviously that's that triggers a use after free so few taxes for people don't know basically stands for a fast user space mutex there honestly not used very often in fact I don't think I've ever used one I don't know if you've ever used onesie I don't know if I know anyone who's ever used one they're like really low level so that's part of the reason why this subsystem is so complex and why even even Jan horn doesn't know 100% what's going on here it's kind of applying guesswork to an issue that he found and what makes it even more interesting is if you you scroll down to the bottom even says I'm not even sure how you'd go about fixing it or something to that effect it is just it's one of those like weird bugs that it's like okay I can see it I can reproduce it but it's such a weird subsystem that I don't even I don't even know what's causing it really so it's just it's one of those pool you know generally when you're talking about Colonel you're already dealing with a hard subject matter but you know this one seems to be a like on a whole nother level like just absolutely crazy and you know that that makes sense because you're talking about virtual file system stuff that stuff generally does get like that is basically as complex as you can get and the colonel in my opinion so</div></div><div

mentioned is you have the few tax being used around a file mapping and the few text itself only goes for so the gift few text key it'll access as you mentioned that I know directly Lee rather than doing a slow walk through the VMA train actually finding the file a few textures go straight to that underlying page via the get user page fast function it only sees that I note so it's not holding as you mentioned it's not holding that reference to the Mount point so if you do destroy that mount point which will implicitly destroy the inode it's not going to know about it it's not going to receive any notification it's like I don't think it's too hard to get the core issue here exactly why that happens I mean so that's where maybe it's a little bit confusing but at the very least like the core issue here is it's basically just skipped a step for the purposes of performance by not doing that slow walk through the entire trade to find the page properly and actually get the full Struck it just has the inode value so I don't think it's that complicated to understand that core issue</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

sure if it was the mount point exactly or if it was the the Callback being specified so you know there is a bit of like uncertainty I guess</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=6139" class="timestamp">01:42:19</a><div class="content"> yeah but I mean the core issue is that effectively because it's skips that step by just going to the inode because it's skips that it's not it's something's missing there so you're able to free cuz its parent effectively don't get its parent destroyed like that core is she doesn't seem too bad to understand there are some questions like he does mention I'm not really sure what the best fix for the actual bug would be and I mean he does mention the strafe or just walk the tree for the look up but at the same time that's going to be a significant performance hit like there's probably a reason why they don't walk the tree</div></div><div class="line"><div

was helping out with the Miura Colonel rootkit for the PS4 stuff it's so hard to write good kernel code so you know I don't even like you like some kernel bugs like the next one we're going to get into our egregious I don't think they're really forgivable but I'm generally a lot more forgiving with kernel bugs because they're just they're so easy to make and there's they can be tough to fix

line of I'm just going to pull it up here first line of the patches that he submitted there's a readme along with in the repo this is a this project have done my and ignore all the bad grammar it's as

saying that it was the let me tap into it just saying it is not clear if the posted patch set is an official Huawei release or whether the code is already shipped on any Huawei devices but the patch set uses Huawei in its name so just because it has it in its name is why they attached at the Huawei and okay parents kind of silly anyway yeah the issue is really simple they have a right Handler and you know when you're when you're writing a day you're going to be copying data from user land into a kernel buffer that kernel buffer happens to be a stack buffer of 32 bytes and they take a user provided length and they don't do any checks on it they just pass it right to copy from user so it's just a straight up stack Overflow awesome yeah which so</div></div><div class="line"><div

have some understanding Landing of some kernel exploits how some of that happens because they did at least make an attempt let me pull the GitHub back up they do actually make an attempt here at introducing some particular self-protection they mentioned the cred guard namespace car like they talk about number of issues here that are you know legitimate things to try and protect against said somebody that has some issue and yet still makes those completely basic mistakes oh man I don't know I guess it's yeah it's a little bit weird that said I don't okay I was going to say I don't see where they have Huawei as their organization but like I'm pretty sure that's like literally just like I think that's a user provided value like I don't think there's a part of like I GitHub I don't

yeah and the irony is well of it being like you know a colonel self-protection driver that has this kind of issue yeah it's pretty funny that being said we'll move on to research will move into vaccines everybody loves vaccines so this is a post by a black arrow and it's called Ragnarok stopper development of a vaccine so I must say I do love the idea of vaccines or just messing with malware in general this is kind of off topic but I just kind of want to bring up a talk that I remember at Defcon a few years ago there was a talk I saw at Defcon 26 I want to say I was talking about fuzzing for and exploiting vulnerabilities and malware to kill the malware was like it was one of the most interesting talks so I can remember seeing but basically the idea of vaccines is you find something that the malware checks that will shut itself down from running like a VM check or something like that and you abuse that to basically Force the malware not to run</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=6692" class="timestamp">01:51:32</a><div class="content"> yeah and I think actually there has been previous Research into and to creating more of a general-purpose vaccine that would make make your normal system look like it's a VM so malware just wouldn't run on it so it's not a new idea but I don't think we've had the opportunity to actually talk about this idea of a malware vaccine before</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=6713" class="timestamp">01:51:53</a><div class="content"> on the podcast so that's kind of why I want to bring this one up in particular I don't think like this is terribly interesting like you understand the idea as you mentioned you're just trying to find you find something check that the malware does I know are forced not run because ideally malware's trying to remain undetected so part of that is when an analyst will open it and take a look at you want to detect that and not do anything malicious during that period so it's like an automated tool examining the malware it's gonna be like okay it doesn't do anything to whirring so whatever you know let's Let It Go that's kind of where love these come down from this this vaccine in particular doesn't this one in particular it will use a crate event will use the event to and if you're not familiar it's basically like at least as I understand it effectively Like This Global Flay kind of thing you have between different programs the create event and windows so it'll create a unique event that way only one instance of the malware actually runs at a time so you don't have like the to and says running trying to encrypt the same files or something if it's around somewhere so in this case so if you just beat the mail worked creating that event and make it think that it's already running it'll just not run any further it doesn't do any check besides checking if this event objects already been</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=6806" class="timestamp">01:53:26</a><div class="content"> created yeah kinda reminds me of when I saw before I can't remember the exact malware I want to say it was maybe muri or something like that but there was one where they just took like a mutex or whatever like a global lock and the vaccine literally just took that lock first and then none of the actual malware instances could ever take the lock and they would never run so yeah I mean it's kind of the same idea here you know they're just they're they're using that a fingerprint and they're abusing it against them our itself so what are your what are your opinions on on malware vaccine see because I'm curious</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi"

exactly like real life actually like I remember hearing you know with the common cold you could create a vaccine for it but there's so many different strains of it that it's just not worth the resources and I think that can kind of be applied to malware as well is there so many different kinds of malware out there and different like a modifications of previous malware it's like it's going to be hard to get a generic catch-all vaccine if you can that'd be really cool but if you have to Target a vaccine for every single one of them is just you're just going to be playing a losing game it's just a sucker's bet yeah just do that with I'd agree with that but it is fun it's fun to think about like I was saying like I really enjoyed that talked last year about exploiting bugs and

and all of that it's just a real world study of some Rust programs inspection of in this case 70 rust memory safety issues like actual issues that were discovered in real-world software and a hundred

this paper was just look at how memory safety issues are being introduced into rust applications because like stood like there is kind of an understanding that Russ is generally like a fairly safe language to use tries to have some compile time guarantees there even though it's a native language it tries to kind of keep some performance with the zero cost abstractions and still have security

different things but 17 they had 21 buffer overflows and the airs tended to happen in 17 of them so in most of them and 17 of the 21 The Heirs would happen when they would compute the buffer size or index and safe code but then the out of bounds would happen later in unsafe code and generally speaking a lot of these are just kind of talking about how other the issue who started and unsafe and ended up impact with safe code or started and save code and impact on safe nothing was like completely safe code all</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter"

all around like there is no they didn't find any issues that didn't involve some unsafe code at some point so as I mentioned the buffer overflows tended to happen where you would compute that buffer size and safe code use of later and go out of bounds some are would happen when doing that computation and safe code but they also has like uninitialized memory again this is unsafe link to safe code this time where they would use the unsafe code create some uninitialized buffer and then read it or use it in their safe code they had a few invalid freeze 5 out of 10 of them kind of shared the pattern where they would and this was actually one of the interest once because this is kind of a pattern you might see in something like C++ or C but in Rust it's particularly exploitable or at least it's a particular issue if you're watching on the left hand side of the screen there's this unsafe function ft</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7201" class="timestamp">02:00:01</a><div class="content"> and what goes on there as you've got an allocation size of whatever the file object is mutable file and then you assign a new file to with the buffer and the vector and there you're assigning that file to it winds up happening there and this is the common parent that they found for invalid freeze where you would allocate this in this case the variable F the right size and when you assign that new file structure to F that ends the lifetime of the old one resulting in that old previous structure getting free despite the fact there was still uninitialized memory within it and that is the the buff Vector inside of that file struck so it's an invalid free unique to rust so I found that a little bit interesting that said I'm not like your initial your exploitation scenario for that is going to have to be getting something inside of that memory that's getting freed so it's I don't immediately see to yeah I don't immediately see the exploitation of that but it is a memory safety issue that's unique to rust that's kind of cool yeah and so they also talk kind of use after freeze which generally what happened just a lot of sorry</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7289"

introduced kind of Elsewhere so I just figured that was worth pointing out the comet there was that he found a real Rusty uaf it was said as Sal of morning it's if hard are but they fix that about a year ago a hundred percent Russ code know it's safe so that's kind of where I want to make the bench there's in this case like a lot of them talk about where the unsafe is but the unsafe part of it wasn't necessarily exposed the end user and they kind of have that as one of their insights so is interior unsafe as being a good way to encapsulate the unsafe stuff so that is having like a function to have just exporting it as unsafe having it as like an internal leaves it so people can be using kind of the safe interface</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7522" class="timestamp">02:05:22</a><div class="content"> so on that note I did kind of have a question on this before we move on to shout-out see yep what are your thoughts generally around unsafe because when when you talk to like people who really love rust and people really hate rust there's like a big controversy around unsafe some people think it's really dumb that it's even supported some people think that you know it the common thing I've seen around it is it allows you to do stuff that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do and it at least marks that hey this is like a big red flag there could be something bad you're like if you're running into issues it's probably in this area since this Mark is unsafe you follow like in that latter category</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7568" class="timestamp">02:06:08</a><div class="content"> yeah I definitely fall into the category that thinks that's good to Mark those unsafe areas I think that's definitely a positive Improvement because when it comes to doing a code review if you have to check all the code like you can do it you can do a code review over absolutely every line of code and in fact like that should be done also but having things marked as unsafe gives you an idea of where where to focus your time where somebody who's cares about security should be looking at so when when you see that on saves like okay I have to take special care here to make sure this doesn't have any side effects that are going to be abused later whereas if you don't have a marked as unsafe everything is fair</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7610" class="timestamp">02:06:50</a><div class="content"> game yeah I mean the common argument I see against unsafe and rust is that it's kind of antithetical to what Russ is trying to accomplish but I mean I can but it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7623" class="timestamp">02:07:03</a><div class="content"> needs to be unique you can't as a language it's trying to be able to work in like that system area and sometimes you need to be able to bring done save code that's actually one of the insights that they make in this paper inside number one is most unsafe usages are are for good or unavoidable reasons they mentioned that indicates that Russ rule checks are sometimes too strict and that's useful that useful to provide an alternative way to escape those checks but still at the core point there is a lot of the unsafe usage it does have a purpose and either Russ needs to stop checking that which way do we can overall security or keep the strict security but allow people to say hey I know what I'm doing now I'm going to do that in anybody else can come along and see hey they think they know what they're doing let's prove them</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7679" class="timestamp">02:07:59</a><div class="content"> wrong yeah kind of like I want to take the you know the flotation device off I can swim you know what I mean and I cut Edge towards that to like you know it's very useful to be able to narrow down your focus on trying to nail down a bug and have that functionality available to you then just not have it at all so yeah I had towards the same way but I was curious if you had like a you know I one of the I think it's the unsafe people</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7706" class="timestamp">02:08:26</a><div class="content"> know I thought when you're going bring up on safe I thought you were going to talk about the unsafe gation which is like whether or not you should have if you use any unsafe code should all the code that uses that unsafe be considered unsafe</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7721" class="timestamp">02:08:41</a><div class="content"> so that's kind of why I was talking about before deception levels I don't know if I could go that that big brain</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7728" class="timestamp">02:08:48</a><div class="content"> yeah I mean it's definitely a debate that's out there though I mean we definitely don't need to discuss it I imagine we probably both just agree that it would make little sense to actually have that unsafe propagate</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7743" class="timestamp">02:09:03</a><div class="content"> yeah no I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7744" class="timestamp">02:09:04</a><div class="content"> just everything would be unsafe because eventually as like the really low level it is necessary</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7751" class="timestamp">02:09:11</a><div class="content"> yeah the question is when do you stop considering it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7754" class="timestamp">02:09:14</a><div class="content"> unsafe yeah so I mean it's like yeah well oh just end up like if everything became everything would become unsafe because I can use the factor something I don't know Factor actually uses on safe anywhere in it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7767" class="timestamp">02:09:27</a><div class="content"> but so Z all I know you have a few shoutouts I don't really have any shoutouts to this is going to be kind of here your solo section of the show but yeah I know I know you have some shout outs and one of them is actually the other zdi post of wasn't posted today yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7786" class="timestamp">02:09:46</a><div class="content"> well that's wonderful there's the three there once it has EDI post will have the description yeah we'll have the discretion in okay I will have the link in the description of the others EDI post I mean it's there we I thought that the windows one was a little bit more interesting one of the other post so was from Rhino security labs and introduction to Google Cloud platform privilege escalation and it's just that it's actually a part of a two-parter that just talks about some different privilege escalation techniques I didn't think it was worth kind of covering on the show because it's not like India wax flight but if that's an area it seems like a pretty good resource and the last thing has a shout-out is from Maddie Stone and John Hopkins University beat the machine Workshop seems like there's something that she worked on a few years ago if you're not familiar with Maddie Stone part of project zero we've talked we've covered her right up before and I know we've covered one presentation by her or maybe the presentation was attached either we've talked about some for work before yeah for sure and so what she has is it's an introduction to reverse engineering and I thought it was an interesting approach some actually I spent a little bit more time talking about this shout out but it's focused it's fairly beginner it's something you could probably do in a couple hours or less it depends on what your if your experience with this you all doing like minutes but its Target audiences from middle school to college students who have you know some programming exposure some familiarity with binary or hexadecimal but like not much more than that as an introduction to reverse engineering and just a few problems we've got a picture of one where you essentially go from they show you the binary you know white boxes and black boxes for one or four zeros</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7903" class="timestamp">02:11:43</a><div class="content"> and ones</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7904" class="timestamp">02:11:44</a><div class="content"> and then you decode that binary into the instruction are well into the office into the into the acid disassembly well so it's a it's a very basic language or instruction set let me go back and to be clear that's the difficult one the easier ones provide more information like you don't have to do the binary translation but just provides this really simple fortunately I don't have a picture of it very simple instruction set so you kind of get that process of going through that process of kind of doing that translation to understand how that works and yeah I thought it was just an interesting approach on that again something you could probably it's I want to say there's four or five exercises on there so there's not a lot to it there is a presentation that goes along with it also like slides are available but I did think it was an interesting approach because one I mean you could do it on paper and it doesn't actually require you to Mike have a computer in front of you it is something you can do it's easy enough that you could explain kind of how to do with the kids although it sounds like Specter thinks that's just</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7977" class="timestamp">02:12:57</a><div class="content"> insanity well I was just looking at it well honestly to be honest I didn't realize it was a it was a custom instructions said I thought they were trying to get you to decode x86 instructions by the bits I'm like what dude</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=7992" class="timestamp">02:13:12</a><div class="content"> no it's a lot simpler it's it's more like a risk system if I recall to wear that stabbed it's fixed size instructions and all</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=8002" class="timestamp">02:13:22</a><div class="content"> that yeah that makes more</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/S1Ol46vkzhQ?t=8004" class="timestamp">02:13:24</a><div class="content"> sense like if I recall it's like move is like a 4-bit here zero byte well zero nibble and then like four bits basically just adding up to the different registers and four bits on the other one for the same thing so fairly it's pretty easy to actually kind of figure out and like said the easier version of it there's easy medium and difficult the screenshot I've got is from the difficult one the easier ones are the exact same problems the only difference is that they include more information in there so you might get a little bit more of the binary or something but otherwise the same challenges so don't think you're going to work through the easy and then the medium just for most of our listeners I'd say probably just if you're actually interested with that you know start off with a difficult one number that I mean it's kind of it's definitely approachable like if you have a little bit of programming experience like you kind of understand what assembly is at least like you don't mean no assembly but you kind of understand like it exists it's this is reasonably approachable to you like and it's similar to what you do with actual reverse engineering guys later exercises have you kind of figuring out what the code is doing and decrypting this little Cipher I just think it's a really interesting approach to it because I was trying to find a little while back I going to be doing a presentation F my cousins are to one my cousin's classes some middle-schoolers about exploit development and I was trying to find like some way to introduce that without getting too technical this wouldn't fit that but I did find it interesting like this would definitely be approachable by Middle School students</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter"
