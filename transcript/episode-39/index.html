Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me is zi. So we're just going to jump right into some news. So we have something if you are one of those to cover first and it's something we actually missed a few weeks ago on April 17th realized desktop 3 was released and the big thing that dropped with that was that they actually change the licensing though that the non-commercial use license or the personal license were realized was made free where it wasn't before so we now have Another decompiler out there, that's not $10,000. So that is a pretty big point that we ended up missing especially because we covered Benja last week and we didn't really cover realize much and that's just something we missed somehow. So we definitely wanted to remedy that and</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=62" class="timestamp">00:01:02</a><div class="content"> yeah, I think we kind of missed it. I don't know about you. I saw people talking about realized a little bit like saw some chatter, but I'd remembered realized as like I said, I think we've mentioned we have mentioned it before I think we've looked at it not On stream before but just in general and well didn't like it didn't as far as I know didn't have a decompiler that point either either. Yeah, I don't think it did. So when I saw it, I didn't even know they are planning a decompiler. So I saw people talk about the updates like okay, it's just another update and we don't generally tend to just cover, you know, just standard updates. So I didn't even really look into it. So it was until somebody pointed out know there's a decompiler with it that We actually started looking at it and I think talking before stream. You mentioned that you don't really take too much of a look. At the decompiler yet or have you</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=117" class="timestamp">00:01:57</a><div class="content"> I haven't really looked at realize I am going to be doing a strain that's going to be looking at it probably tomorrow, but some at some point throughout this week. I'm not setting tomorrow like Hart and stone, but I would like to really like do kind of like what we did with Benja on a stream do that with realize. You know, I think for those of you who is there to shake so for</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=137" class="timestamp">00:02:17</a><div class="content"> those of you who didn't catch that also we did do a like for our stream looking at the binge of decompiler. We had want the Ciphertext come in answered some questions. Tell us a little bit about the future like there's a lot of good information in that stream.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=151" class="timestamp">00:02:31</a><div class="content"> Yeah. I think he joined it about 90 minutes in for anybody wants a timestamp for that.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=157" class="timestamp">00:02:37</a><div class="content"> But yeah, so coming on to realize I did take a look at some things mostly things that we noticed Benja did or didn't do so the obvious one was with Binger. We noticed that a lot of are not a lot of but I'll in that bad characters from Rob Emporium. I wasn't doing that. Initialization so I know it's real eyes does have that in there it gets that cracked unsigned local characters gets the type right there. I did find a little bit weird that this fourth line a created it as an array sized one. And yeah did the office like I don't quite get why did it for that one like that?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=196" class="timestamp">00:03:16</a><div class="content"> But many others.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=197" class="timestamp">00:03:17</a><div class="content"> Yeah. And I mean, obviously you tell it the type you tell it's an array it rewrites everything just fine. A few other things I noticed in general. It didn't do for Loops. It would always prefer to Sting the while loop and just having the anti. Yeah similar to what Ghidorah would do which I mean the for Loop is what it was written as prop. Well actually, okay. So in another example that I decompiled, oh is definitely for loop, I would assume this is a for loop from Rob important given what it's doing but I don't technically know that the other thing I noticed here is On line 27 you have the access by index like the array type access but then when its accessing the other array, it just did a pointer calculation added the aqua technically it added the pointer to the offset. So it did that actually most of the time it did intend to create that array index. I just this is another one of those cases where I don't see why saw this one is an array and then wouldn't treat the other one as an</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=267" class="timestamp">00:04:27</a><div class="content"> array. Yeah, there must be a very subtle discrepancy in the instructions that like it just</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=274" class="timestamp">00:04:34</a><div class="content"> interpreted. Well, I tried looking at that and I couldn't nothing really stood out to me as to why I would do that and you know been Joe would treat this just as the pointer arithmetic it wouldn't even do the array index. So technically I mean realize doing a little bit better on that. So those are kind of a couple things. I know she's just looking at this bad characters loop again. We just need to find the other screenshot I have. I want the other things here. So this was I would have just like a little dummy program that I wrote and we had mentioned on ninja kind of the Annoying size conversions in line 12 on this rotates ring. You see like the cast unsigned and cash</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=321" class="timestamp">00:05:21</a><div class="content"> character pointer</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=324" class="timestamp">00:05:24</a><div class="content"> and owned. It still seemed a little bit excessive in this case to not as bad or at least definitely a lot more readable than binary ninjas was but still a little bit excessive compared to what probably could be done. Unfortunately. I didn't have G drill went to do comparisons back and forth on this one. I just kind of took what I remembered from Benja. And just apply that on to looking at the realize one here. It did create this variable size and that that's in the in the assembly itself course it it pulls that out as kind of its own little own little thinks. That's fair. Gives a you know, kind of that nice readable name so I gained kind of a fair move there. Once</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=374" class="timestamp">00:06:14</a><div class="content"> I will say in general like the samples you've been pulling up. I do find the syntax to be a little bit more readable than binges and I think that might be because it's closer to C code. Yeah, and that's like I kind of prefer that style. You know what I mean? I like it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=390" class="timestamp">00:06:30</a><div class="content"> I high-level my speaking of compilable. Here's my grape can copy and paste code. I could not find any way to extract this piece. That's why these are all screenshots with Bender. I copied the code. I will put it into my editor. So I had like it's highlighting. Yes, as far as I can tell and I'm sure somebody's going to correct me on this and I hope somebody does but I could not find a way to copy just a line of code out or the whole thing. I could have like save as Oh,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=426" class="timestamp">00:07:06</a><div class="content"> that's like a glaring missing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=427" class="timestamp">00:07:07</a><div class="content"> functionality. It does like nothing. I tried. So on Binger a few if you happen to click on what the key words, it would kind of highlight the line and then sub highlight the key word that he clicked on. If you tried to copy it would just copy the keyword with realized so sorry back on binges. But if you happen to just click the line make sure there are no other highlights are did copy like it would copy the whole line you can drag through. And copy everything with this you could copy keywords out, but you couldn't like drag over to copy multiple keywords. You couldn't just select the whole line. It would copy nothing in that case. So that's actually kind of an issue here. But I do feel like that's more of an oversight or like a bug not an intended feature. Although on that note. I will say and this is something I felt when I first he's realized like it's a really polished UI but I dislike it. I just I wouldn't want to use it. I don't like its UI. But it is fairly polished. I'm not sure exactly what it is. It just it's not it's not my workflow and he can change it kind of how I would normally work. I guess just how would she know some of the tabs? There are some customizations. It's just, you know, definitely kind of a personal preference thing to say. I don't really like it but that is a very personal thing. Like I'm not going to say nobody should use this because I don't like it. I mean obviously they've created something somebody's using yet somebody's paying for it. It's Y'all just personally I didn't really like the UI but it is very polished like it's a nice Cy. but</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=533" class="timestamp">00:08:53</a><div class="content"> we got something I'll ask for when you were investigating.

I do notice just with your screen shot though. This is like a minor gripe, you know, it's nothing big at if you know the data types, you can probably follow along but what I found interesting is with the parameters it'll actually denote in 64 for like the return types in the parameters. But then for the local variables in the function, they don't use those explicit types. They use like intend long and those can be a little bit. Using because when you start talking about long in Windows and Linux, they mean different things in Windows along is 32 bits and Linux along a 64 bits. So I would prefer if they had some of those more explicit types. So instead of unsigned long size. They had you and 64 size or or keep it consistent underscore underscore in 64 sighs.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=629" class="timestamp">00:10:29</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and that's something that I think Binger gets pretty well is listen. Yeah, just as a general not necessarily. Back to Gap or just generally when they do the code. It's they're very explicit with everything which kind of ends up be making a little bit verbose a little bit unreadable at times but they are very explicit with what's happening.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=651" class="timestamp">00:10:51</a><div class="content"> It can be at times but on other times, you know, if you're looking for bugs you having access to that size right there and not having to think about it. It can be a</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=661" class="timestamp">00:11:01</a><div class="content"> oh, yeah, I think it's definitely it's a good thing for Benja to do that. Like I do it's also like their annotations and stuff. off With those annotations, what ends up happening is you have as you're saying like a lot of information just available at your fingertips. That's why I keep going to mentioning it the like signed and unsigned comparisons. It's such a small thing that I didn't notice. I was missing until I saw them actually have that. Yeah,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=691" class="timestamp">00:11:31</a><div class="content"> here's a bit of a fun question. Not one that's really related to decompiling or anything like that. Would you like it if that was actually like a language feature if you had to specify if it was an unsigned or son to compare because I know like currently it's basically to do this by the types unsigned has a higher precedence than sign. So if you have an unsigned argument in the in the like comparison, it's going to be an unsigned compare, but you don't really know that when you're looking at Code you've got to know what happens at the compiler level to know if it's a signed or unsigned to compare or you have to like look through the types. And sometimes you have type definitions and you have to go up like, you know, a bunch of lines to see what the original type was the would you like if like in development you had to specify what kind of comparison you wanted second</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=739" class="timestamp">00:12:19</a><div class="content"> question and no I would have liked it but as an optional feature</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=748" class="timestamp">00:12:28</a><div class="content"> It could be a cool idea anything like if it would show you, you know, you hover over the conditional Titan showing it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=754" class="timestamp">00:12:34</a><div class="content"> Like I think it's definitely useful and doing the re writing the code because the way that would mostly be used as just a force one way or the other. Yeah. I know it feels like that.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=766" class="timestamp">00:12:46</a><div class="content"> Adding a little web much for the programmers.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=769" class="timestamp">00:12:49</a><div class="content"> I can understand though if you want to do that as a as an optional</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=775" class="timestamp">00:12:55</a><div class="content"> feature Yeah, and that actually brings up something not related to languages. But with the decompiler that I think would be cool here is what you were saying earlier with like the explicitness sometimes being able or leading to like unreadable code what I think would be a really good solution here was if you had an option to show explicit types if you just right click and go, okay, so explicit types or you could use the unsigned enter longer whatever if you wanted the more readable version and you could just switch When you want it to see</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=807" class="timestamp">00:13:27</a><div class="content"> you know what?

Yeah, I think that would be a really Really cool addition in both but yeah, so like jumping back to that not being able to copy code. Hopefully like you said that's just an oversight. Even if there is a way to do it that it should be a lot more intuitive than that. Like the fact that you had to struggle to do. It is a problem in itself. Even if it is possible through some weird obscure UI thing. So that's something that needs to be worked on one thing one other thing. I did want to ask with realized since you were talking about Like the UI and stuff does it allow theming support?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=886" class="timestamp">00:14:46</a><div class="content"> Yeah. So this is a theme in particular. I'm not sure if you can do customized themes but they do have some built-in ones. So I immediately switch to this dark solarize theme</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=895" class="timestamp">00:14:55</a><div class="content"> because I know the default is that right? You know? Yeah light theme and I yeah, and I think that should</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=901" class="timestamp">00:15:01</a><div class="content"> not not even just like a hughes's white like like it's not just the right thing it is. So yeah, that was one of the first things I look for and I changed it. So this is kind of I like the theme that I had settled on they only had like three. I feel like they probably do allow custom theming I just and look into that. That's it. I do have a couple other comparisons to bring off one of the things I noticed a lot and this is looking at Ready Player one kind of won four challenges on zero X zero, five three nine dotnet. Is you'll notice in this example and the decompiler it does create thread has a return value and then assign the data 0 x 6 5 5 4 bit basically taking the return value and then tossing it into the actual memory location where it ends up being stored. Which I mean is fair, but what binary ninja does there's it'll compress that into just a single line, which is much more readable granted binary ninja has like, you know that Das header which we already talked about soffits constants are a little bit</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=968" class="timestamp">00:16:08</a><div class="content"> forced.

I think that might be something I would like and binary ninja because it's more explicit and it tells you it's taking the address it's not just directly and that's referencing that. So I think that that might be something that binary ninja is a bit lacking in that screenshot. Yeah. It's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1021" class="timestamp">00:17:01</a><div class="content"> a</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1021" class="timestamp">00:17:01</a><div class="content"> That might just be on the preference, but I would like the aggressive operator Reserve.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1028" class="timestamp">00:17:08</a><div class="content"> I apologize for the audio right now for whoever's listening to us.

So I believe it might have been an interaction with my phone and maybe a quarter or something because I moved my phone and I went away anyway coming back one of the last things I do want to point. Out with realized is also when it's doing so in terms of the loops. I found it would also sometimes do it would just miss the conditional completely for the loop. If you notice in this one. It's got the breakdown at the bottom. Rather than so. It's basically that the break can continue their well, it checks a v like this was a for loop again, actually. Yeah, so it just kind of pushes all that to the bomb and I saw a few place where I would do like while one and then some condition towards the end. so Oh, no, I mean it just it ruins kind of flow of reading it rather than having the condition, of course in the loop</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1117" class="timestamp">00:18:37</a><div class="content"> itself.

Yeah. The reason I say that is Benja at least on air and it was missing is some lifting it was for x86 as well. But only really on the extended stuff on are M. It was missing some Instructions lifting so it'd be interesting to see if realize has those instructions lifted just because if they are lifted and the decompiler output is probably going to be better on that front too. But we you know, that's something that I want to look at on Scream so I can't speak too much on that right now, but we'll look at that on on the stream.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1304" class="timestamp">00:21:44</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and it's something that I had meant to kind of take some time to look at but never got around to over the weekend.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1310" class="timestamp">00:21:50</a><div class="content"> Yeah fair enough, so I don't really have too much more to add there. I don't I don't so if you do but now I'll just cap that off with saying, you know, I'm going to be doing the stream looking at it so well and outside on the Twitter and in the Discord, so anybody who's interested can look at that and we'll see how it shapes up basically. And we'll try to do that tomorrow, but I don't want to give any promises on that. So that being said I think we'll move on to Firefox Firefox is actually updated their Bounty. Now this is this does say in 2019 and into the future so they have some like statistics and stuff in there. But I think the biggest change that they're doing here is they're no longer running a first reporter winds policy. There are now going to be splitting Downey's between all duplicates Within. 72 hours hours. Yeah, which honestly I don't know if I like that but they do do parade of the mounts for higher quality reports as well. They're also going to be raising payouts for higher impact bugs. Sandbox. Escape is going to be 8 to 10 K proxy bypass is going to be three to five k and they've also started a Blog called the the attack and defense blog which might be of interest to like viewers of our stuff like that now I did Kind of want to point out like that first reporter wins versus the you know, Bobby's being split part. How do you feel about that? Because like I said earlier, I don't think I like that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1399" class="timestamp">00:23:19</a><div class="content"> I met at the same time. Do you like being told you're things that duplicate because somebody magic finish their report a couple hours before you I know you don't like that either so but here's the problem if you're the first to report</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1413" class="timestamp">00:23:33</a><div class="content"> it and then let's say some information somehow gets leaked or something and then somebody else reports it and then you lose money out of your report. That sucks. So it's like I think I would if I had to choose</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1425" class="timestamp">00:23:45</a><div class="content"> one. I feel like 72 hours is a pretty short period though. It is like it's really just because they're trying to encourage people to look at their nicely and find issues that come up right in the nightly builds. I mean and that's you know constantly changing and so people if they're afraid duplicate psycho. He found the same bug everybody else fuzzing nicely did there for you? Just don't get it there for you. Just don't fuzz. Oh, I feel like 72 hours is a sufficiently short amount of time to prevent a lot of guy duplicates from something leaking or whatever. It's 72 hours. Isn't that long in the grand scheme of things?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1469" class="timestamp">00:24:29</a><div class="content"> I mean, it's a hard issue to solve because like you were saying earlier with the first reporter wins policy anyone who submits it after kind of gets screwed and it's not a great situation for them at the same time. It's unreasonable to expect the vendor to pay. Like, you know a standard payout for all duplicate reports, especially if it's some like trash bug that gets found by everyone fussing it, you know what I mean? But this one is kind of sucks too. Because if it is a trash bag that a lot of people fuzz for then okay before you would have had one person that got a payout and the rest of the people didn't get anything right in this case you could end up with a lot of people reporting it and everyone getting like next to nothing now though.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1515" class="timestamp">00:25:15</a><div class="content"> They do mention your high quality report to do still gaining you that like the Plus on it. I see you still like if you spend the time to do a good rapport, where's everybody else some myths just like crash. You're still going to be getting more than everybody else. That's that part. If it isn't being split off that also touches on cat 3009 out of chat to mentions, you know, there's some time you spend to you sir. I'll just read you know after you On the back there's some time what you spent analyze that you could spend two days just create a high quality report on the other hand. Someone else can just submit a crash. So Mozilla does trying task that a little bit with this and being one you can update here report after you submit so you submit the trash and then you keep updating it because the payouts being based on kind of the follow-up discussion not on the initial report. So they're trying to tackle that issue. They are splitting. Yes, but if you have a higher quality report, you do still end up with a higher payout. Maybe not as much. But I mean at least they're trying to do something and I think it's fair for them to be trying to do something about this issue because duplicates is one in my life and want the biggest grapes. I hear from people about doing bug bounties is you know, something's just marked as a dual. Can you don't get paid at all for any of the time you spend so I think this is at least positive step is a perfect know. I don't know. What a perfect solution here would be either.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1612" class="timestamp">00:26:52</a><div class="content"> Well, that one thing that I think would be cool. If they did was, you know, keep the pro rating based on higher quality reports, but also do like a bonus for whoever reports it first. You know what I mean? That way they're still getting like I think being the first to report the issue should still be of value. You know what I mean? Yeah, but they talking about people who</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1634" class="timestamp">00:27:14</a><div class="content"> who end up reporting, you know, they say mere hours after another reporter.

It really comes down to you know, who you know who writes faster than and that's what it is. Now. It's just whoever writes faster kind of gets it.

Yeah, I mean, that's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1685" class="timestamp">00:28:05</a><div class="content"> fine. We can we can agree to disagree a little bit on that. I think it's just how much value you place on that first blood and really what it is what it comes down to overall though. I agree that it is a I think overall excluding just that change like taking all into account like raising the payouts and doing the prorated based on the high quality reports. I think those are really good steps. It's just the one with the you know, splitting the boundary between them is a little bit shaky.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1713" class="timestamp">00:28:33</a><div class="content"> No, I mean I still think it's better than not splitting yet.

I don't really have much to add on there. We'll move on to one of the bigger stories of the week, which was the source code for csgo and TF2 being leaked from 2017 and 2018. So there was a lot of misinformation going around around this this news. There was a lot of people I saw people saying I never going to launch csgo again. I'm just going to get exploited as soon as I get into a game and that's just that's just ridiculous. Alice just because the source code is out doesn't mean going to be exploited the moment you join a Lobby that's just absurd. I think a lot of information was spread from people who aren't familiar with with development or security or anything like that and they</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1870" class="timestamp">00:31:10</a><div class="content"> just have so there's actually one thing in this chain that I want to find a readout, you know, title their major security risk. This is not a chain message that sound, you know, there's been a huge Source leaked. And effectively they mention here all games running Source are now super vulnerable against the various purposes. And if you play TF2 csgo or any other source game, you're taking a major security risk. We advise all our players to take a break from these games until further updates come out. And for those reasons we're also shutting down our servers later tonight. So it's not like valve knows all of it has valve, right? Yeah. Okay. It's not like valve knows all of the exploits that are in their past code that they haven't yet patched and then you know, these future updates are going magically patch all of them. So just on that little bit where it's saying until further updates come out. It's like, you know any issues that are found here that are going to take a While to be found to use notice and then actually patch so it's not like oh, yeah next update you're going to be good to go that said is you're consenting just because the sources out there. This is several several years old. Well as that one's 30 2018. Yeah. So sir couple years old, then there are few years, whatever. It's not ancient. But it's not these are games that are also update fairly frequently. So there's going to be a lot of turnover.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1968" class="timestamp">00:32:48</a><div class="content"> I do actually have a Counterpoint to that. I think the networking stack from people I've heard of the or like people I know that deal with Source engine and stuff at least the networking stack. I don't think they really touch that much. It doesn't really change much. Yeah. It</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=1982" class="timestamp">00:33:02</a><div class="content"> was just going to get into that you there's going to be a lot of turnover in some areas, but not everywhere. There are going to be some areas that Don't get much out of it. As you said the network stack being one of those. I'm sure there are some core engine areas of probably don't get touched super often either. So there's definitely going to be people that are finding bugs because of this but they also may be bugs that have stuck around for at least a couple of years already, which she does. Go ahead.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2013" class="timestamp">00:33:33</a><div class="content"> Well, I'm just going to say it'll be easier to find bugs maybe because you have the source code, you know. Like source code auditing is easier than binary auditing typically.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2023" class="timestamp">00:33:43</a><div class="content"> Yeah. It's just there's going to be that signal to noise ratio. There's going to be a lot of noise because the game like this isn't the current Source.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2031" class="timestamp">00:33:51</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and the other problem is exploiting sorts engine is actually a lot more difficult than people think and the reason for that is There's one thing that's very hard to do for any rce for anything and that's going to be info leaked to abuse an ASL art environment. You are going to need to bypass address space layout randomization and you're going to need an info lead to do that. And that's very difficult to accomplish within rce. You can find buffer overflows and Source engine fairly easily from what I know. It's not hard to find, you know bugs that lead to memory corruption. The harder part is being able to actually We leverage them because they're in components that are just they're hard to info league in and that's that's basically all there is to it. So even if you find a bug that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be easy to exploit. It could take you months to be able to try to exploit that bug so, you know just adding on to that point that just because the source code is out doesn't mean there's suddenly going to be exploits flying around for csgo and TF2.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2096" class="timestamp">00:34:56</a><div class="content"> Yeah. I mean again though like no doubt it helps, but you're not suddenly every Care either any of the bugs that are found have been in there for at least a couple years. So you've been a terrorist for the last couple years all so it's just a little bit easier. Now, I will say that does he'll probably in the sense of just being able to understand the overall architecture of things to getting that big picture from what it used to look like that in the background knowledge. Yeah, like it's definitely useful for people looking for</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2128" class="timestamp">00:35:28</a><div class="content"> issues. Now here's one thing that a lot of people that you know reacted to this didn't even really consider. This isn't the first time that source code is slate. Source engine is leak before I ate soooo pretty old now. I think it's maybe 2007-2008. So it is pretty dated but the source code is leaked before and There hasn't really been an RC e exploit campaign that I'm aware of that is targeted csgo or TF2 there have been exploits that have been used but they're mostly like Dawson's games, you know, crashing games on people. They're not, you know deploying malware or something like</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2174" class="timestamp">00:36:14</a><div class="content"> that. Yeah. I mean, I actually when we talked about the csgo days, I'm like episode like two or three or something like really early. Yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2184" class="timestamp">00:36:24</a><div class="content"> upon it. I don't even think it really affect the csgo. Yeah, it's 1.6.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2187" class="timestamp">00:36:27</a><div class="content"> I think there was like a minor wait impacted CS csgo. But I mean that's kind of the other thing. I think a lot of the people looking at source engine or looking at it for the Bounty valve has a decent bounty on it and there</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2201" class="timestamp">00:36:41</a><div class="content"> were probably one of the better ones on hacker one.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2204" class="timestamp">00:36:44</a><div class="content"> Yeah. So I mean, I think a lot of people are looking at for that enough for malicious purposes. I mean, obviously there are malicious things it could be done. But I mean if if you're targeting somebody it's probably not through csgo like I don't know if feels like csgo is a really the normal route. That would be targeted.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2228" class="timestamp">00:37:08</a><div class="content"> That's not an ideal Vector.

So people playing on official servers. Is the bugs not going to affect them anyway, so it's one of those things where it also the attack surface is kind of limited and what you're going to look for on official servers. So that's another thing to consider their there's something else I wanted to say. Oh, yeah, so overall I think Four players for csgo players TF2 players this this basically doesn't really mean much to them. I mean cool, you know that it's leaked if you want to check that out. Maybe you can I haven't really gone looking for the league because I'm not really that interested. Maybe it's something you want to know if you're a player and take into consideration. I'm not going to tell people whether to play or not to play, you know, I don't think I should be doing that. But what I will say is I think overall the only person is really hurts is valve. It's a bit embarrassing for them. Now. This this wasn't like somebody hacked into the you know valve and then stole the source code. This was a leak from a Dev who had access to the repo. It was a disgruntled employee that was like laid off or something like that and put it out there though, but you know, it could be I think there were some chat logs and stuff that relate to so it's mostly just a bit of an embarrassment for valve. I don't think in her players and stuff like that or the public at large this even really needs to be considered. I think it was blown bar out of proportion compared to what is actually</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2337" class="timestamp">00:38:57</a><div class="content"> yeah.

So we'll move into our into our last news topic before doing some exploits and that's fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities and malicious code execution in XG firewall, so, There was a report received on April 22nd about a suspicious field being exposed in the management interface for the XG firewall and they did some this is so</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2371" class="timestamp">00:39:31</a><div class="content"> Folks by the way Friend by listening.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2373" class="timestamp">00:39:33</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and you know after they did some investigation and they found it was an attack on fire wall units. They basically use day zero day pre authentication SQL injection to hit exposed XG devices. So using that they exfiltrated, you know data from like fire. Hours of data they got local user names. They got hash passwords. They fixed it and sent out an alert to everyone who was affected which I do have like a question on one of their alerts, but I'll get to that in a minute. We I don't think I couldn't really see any information like technical information on exactly why yes, Carol. I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2411" class="timestamp">00:40:11</a><div class="content"> was that's why this has definitely left as just a news topics. We don't have the technical details about what the SQL injection actually was. Is just it was preauth SQL injection allowed them to get information and it was actively being abused in some campaign that they had noticed. So what they did they had to alerts that went out either the alert went out with that just the hotfix was applied. Their device wasn't compromised or they actually tried to clean up the calm part of the compromise itself and they sent out the alert mention cough fix applied and partially cleaned up.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2451" class="timestamp">00:40:51</a><div class="content"> And here's my thing. I think it is a little bit sneaky how they did that. I you know, we I think II alert is cut off because it says additional and then there's nothing else but you know, so take it with a grain of salt. Maybe it's just because they left the full alert out of the screenshot but it seems like they're downplaying the alert for people who are actually affected because in the one that were they weren't affected they have not affected in big capital letters and then the second one is just like oh it was partially cleaned. And like unless you look at this page, you might not immediately assume that you were compromised from that alert its</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2486" class="timestamp">00:41:26</a><div class="content"> feel like that's an alert that you're probably going to click on if you see that.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2492" class="timestamp">00:41:32</a><div class="content"> I don't know. I just feel like it should have been made more obvious than the first sentence that it was the, you know, you were actually affected, you know, or you were compromised now, so I believe they did</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2503" class="timestamp">00:41:43</a><div class="content"> email out customers also.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2507" class="timestamp">00:41:47</a><div class="content"> Okay, so there is some stipulations there like you're saying maybe they emailed it out and it was more obvious there or that alert has another sentence there that says that makes it more clear because like I said, you can only see that additional work for the second. Sometimes but it's just something I noticed I thought was a little bit weird. It's like I think they should have made it a little bit more obvious in the second alert, but I know I need to</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2529" class="timestamp">00:42:09</a><div class="content"> praise him. Yeah, I don't wanna say they're trying to downplay their I feel like they probably just have a standard way of writing them that did this and then they just tried</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2540" class="timestamp">00:42:20</a><div class="content"> to in about five minutes.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2544" class="timestamp">00:42:24</a><div class="content"> Apparently.

I like it. I like how they provide like a full timeline at the bottom of the page. They quickly investigated fixed and disclosed it. It's one thing you've kind of said over the past in our episode zi is like you care more about how they respond to an attack rather than the fact that the attack happened and I think how they responded here was overall positive, you know, they have the full timeline. They let people know they sent out the email sent out the alerts. They started the investigation as soon as they notice. This is the suspicious field. So it seems overall I think that the right steps were taken. So I think overall I want to give them like props for how they handled it and I am guessing you'd probably agree with</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2606" class="timestamp">00:43:26</a><div class="content"> me. Yeah like they say Tout they notified their community of their initial medications within 24 hours. Just shy like it was so the attack begins at four o'clock on the 22nd and at 3:47 on the 23rd is when they have notified the community about the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2625" class="timestamp">00:43:45</a><div class="content"> issue. Which is fair like you want to do the investigation and get all the details before you you know, send out those initial emails. I can understand them wanting to take you know that 24 hour period take the time and investigated before sending out an email</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2641" class="timestamp">00:44:01</a><div class="content"> why I'm just saying like that's a good response</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2643" class="timestamp">00:44:03</a><div class="content"> time. Regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely though overall, you know, we like to like, you know highlight when a company responds. Well, especially because we've highlighted some companies that haven't responded. Well, so I think overall I think this Is this was a good response?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2660" class="timestamp">00:44:20</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I'd agree with that. And like I said, I don't think there's anything conspiratorial going on with their</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2665" class="timestamp">00:44:25</a><div class="content"> alert. Yeah, it was just something that I noticed initially and I think it's just because like I said, I want to kind of step back on that and say it's just because it's just kind of cut off there and there's probably it's probably more obvious than I would think. You know with that said though, we'll move into some exploits. So our first one is in MSI true color utility, which is used for tweaking color settings and stuff for games from what I could tell</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2693" class="timestamp">00:44:53</a><div class="content"> ya this is, you know, definitely an absolutely unique vulnerabilities. Do that. We've never talked about before seen. Yeah, if you can't hear the sarcasm in my voice here that says and unquoted service path vulnerability yet again, I feel like we've talked about a few of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2711" class="timestamp">00:45:11</a><div class="content"> these. Yep. Oh, they take an input parameter called IP application name which points to a full path for an executable and they pass it to create process as user a which is a win API function and they don't quote the path. The reason that's an issue is that when API function will try to search in a deterministic order for the the executable.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2733" class="timestamp">00:45:33</a><div class="content"> Yeah. Well, I kind of think about it like this when you go on a shell and you want execute, you know a particular file, let's say that's in you know C program files like well if you LS isn't good example because that's rarely going to be somewhere that has a space but like every word so the first word it's going to treat as the command in Windows you obviously have a lot of paths that The path has a space. So program files being the classic example. So if they just did that first word is just going a little can try and execute this C program and then there's a space. So the first word is the first argument. It's the Program you want to know? Well, that's not a program. So it'll pain the next thing next word on to I see if that makes proper path and so on and so on until you get it. So, of course if you just have like C program dot exe, it will execute that it'll execute that with high privileges. But the gist of it is, you know, it's just that it's because it's not handling that space But Windows is trying to do the right thing for you. This is does remind me. I think the last time I'm we talked about this issue. I want to say I was in something with apple like maybe iTunes Theory called that one.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2814" class="timestamp">00:46:54</a><div class="content"> Wasn't a cutie that had a nun quoted after the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2818" class="timestamp">00:46:58</a><div class="content"> Acuity had the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2821" class="timestamp">00:47:01</a><div class="content"> herbs at the dll injection</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2822" class="timestamp">00:47:02</a><div class="content"> was yeah that was where you could like at the argument. But what I range call was that I believe it was it was in something with apple might have been iTunes might been something else but there's all this conspiracy around. Oh, you know this you know these The researchers behind this malware because it was being actively used, you know, did all this look and we're using this iTunes O'Day, whereas they very well might have just created that program dot exe for whatever program might end up executing it. Like it didn't need it. Like this is something I you can go and just create program dot exe. Put it in your C drive. And you know, wait a day and see see if it gets executed by something. Like it's a really easy to find this and it doesn't need to be targeted specifically at like the MSI true color</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2875" class="timestamp">00:47:55</a><div class="content"> service. And that's part of what makes it a bit more impactful is not only is it a privilege escalation because you can get to anti Authority or system. It's also persistent right? Because the executable will be rent every time the service is loaded which is by default on restart. So, you know, if you restart the computer, it's going to load that potentially malicious file if you're being attacked with it on reboot, so it's not only an LTE, but it's also a persistent ope though that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2907" class="timestamp">00:48:27</a><div class="content"> Tiny Fair Factor, it can also like obviously there are cases where this will just be x t as your user to, you know, unquoted path isn't something that only services do like other things do it to just one services do it. It becomes an issue because of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2922" class="timestamp">00:48:42</a><div class="content"> this. So yeah, I think it's not too much to talk about there because it's literally just unquote a path bug so we'll move on to key base. So this was a last-minute addition. This was just posted today and it's a one-click rce on key base. So from what I can understand this guy basically came across a light really weird Quirk by the steak and managed to exploit it. I'll let you cover it City because yeah, it's a look at it too much because it was just posted today, but It seems to be a kind of interesting it was discovered by mistake there and he kind of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=2958" class="timestamp">00:49:18</a><div class="content"> weaponized. Yeah. Well the gist of this is really simple and some cases when using key base, you know sending messages with key base it all encode your message as Basics T4, or is Jason basic and then basic see for it. They give the example there of the Jason like it would use that for some links for it's like tie if you know male 2, you know, what to display and the actual URL to go to so you can like spoof the URL by changing what to display versus what it actually is. That said they couldn't find a way to actually send this base64 encoded string. They only mentioned using the key base GUI CLI and the mobile client. My assumption is you're just going to have to do kind of like the like the rod Network layer to inject that thing not using the standard interface. So I imagine it's probably possible to just send it that said it may not be they do just mention that when they tried to send a user. Seeing any of the normal means it didn't work. Nonetheless, I mean it has such Jason so they had to find something where they could include that jacent that would get converted. That would be handled by something that would decode the basics for some suggest including a message. It wouldn't be which they looked around for it found in lumens, which apparently I'm not familiar with it integrates into the key based client lets you send this xlm coin through key race like her send payment request in chat. And if you include the message body with that that will get parsed. So as a URL include like see what is it see Windows</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3074" class="timestamp">00:51:14</a><div class="content"> calculator Yeah, they just pop</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3076" class="timestamp">00:51:16</a><div class="content"> calc.

So I'm I'm assuming talking about like the daddy you were eyes with type Basics before. That said kind of continuing on with that Specter Kai mentioned. It was was reported as a duplicate. So no payout unfortunately, but they did reply within 15 minutes. Which is awesome. Yeah, a very quick response time, especially to get it notice that to duplicate.

That's all I'm suggesting act. Yeah, it's just I think that is like, you know, not as surprising as it would be for like some other products, for example. Yeah, we'll move on to a more impactful bug which is in jQuery. So it's a jQuery XS through the HTML function and it's in the HTML pre-filter method for jQuery. And that's notable because jQuery is obviously used by like everything. There's a lot of web apps that use jQuery the details on this page. I found a bit weird, but they do link out to a challenge page that has more complete information on what the actual bug is. So that's probably the better page for getting information if you want to look at it essentially, it seems the bug comes down to a discrepancy between how the sanitation treats HTML compared to enter HTML. Ml is a bit of a weird thing going on there when it comes to self-closing tags. So so is hex image for example is a good example of that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3417" class="timestamp">00:56:57</a><div class="content"> if I can jump in quickly. It's all wood jQuery jQuery will do some extra work that inner HTML just wouldn't do so this particular bug if we actually look at the challenge, which I brought up on stream, but essentially it would take your user input. And it would sanitize it for like using Dom purify putting it right into the HTML that want you so in theory using dompierre Feist anti was like this should be solid it and dumped here if I sanitized is sanitizing it to be included in HTML. So if you took this HTML string tossed it into like, you know, whatever whatever div dot inner HTML inner HTML wouldn't do anything more it would take Just toss it right in and kind of crazy HTML tree, obviously the user inputs being purified so it should be okay. Winds up happening with HTML Specter was saying about this pre-filter with the pre-filter would do. And I'll pull up the solution area. Pre-filter would do is it would take those tags that Specter was just mentioning the self-closing takes that's where you have so they actually do a style as their example, which usually isn't a self-closing tag usually want some content in your style tape, but basically where you just have the opening angle bracket style / closing angle brackets kind of that one tag. So the classic example there BR would be one image is often written like that and what it would do is it would replace All self-closing tags or with a full tank. So the open and close tag. I'm not sure why exactly they do that why they don't just leave them like that said I've never really looked at the pre-filter to know what else they're doing. But with that what ends up happening here is when they do that if you also have a dangling, well, it's not dangling normally. So what they do is they do a style tag. Take a self-closing style tag and then a close style tag and after their self closing the action of some content there. What ends up happening is that replacement ends up being dropped in there with the open and closed style and that's Islands up closing. Sorry about that that's style ends up closing the original style tag and the content that was after it ends up being placed kind of after that being completely uncontained.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3580" class="timestamp">00:59:40</a><div class="content"> Yeah, basically breaks out. So what you're able to do</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3584" class="timestamp">00:59:44</a><div class="content"> with that is when it's completely uncontained off so you can start including actual HTML there because it's no longer contain like a would be anti for Style. So script alert and Away you go. Now the challenge itself also does little bit dumb clobbering that I don't think still important to cover here. We've talked about that in past episodes. It's an old attack. So I don't think we need to talk about that. The key thing here is in jQuery because that HTML pre-filter just replacing those self-closing tags. You are able to get excess when something was being passed to the HTML object that shouldn't have been exploitable that said I feel like the use case of this one realistically.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3634" class="timestamp">01:00:34</a><div class="content"> Probably not really going to affect a lot of people using jQuery.

Yeah, you should, you know have some inert egg that he then set with text. Something like that. If you want a sad not trying to inject all the HTML itself, but there are definitely websites that don't follow that best practice. So like there's definitely place where this is going to use its interest because it is in the core jQuery</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3669" class="timestamp">01:01:09</a><div class="content"> Library.

Probably not but you know, but unlike this one which isn't a zero day or next topic is zero day actually for zero days in the IBM data risk manager. So this is a repo that talks about multiple bugs found in the IBM data risk manager, which is a utility that allows Enterprises to manage business security risks. The reason I mentioned that is it'll it the the repo just says security risks and when I read that I usually think like, you know info a sec security risks, but that's not what it actually is. It's business risks, but what's notable here is obviously like I said, there's zero days and it stated it's it's not patched because IBM rejected the vulnerability report. They said it was yeah, it's cope.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3748" class="timestamp">01:02:28</a><div class="content"> I think it's worth talking about that after we talked about the vulnerabilities themself. Yep. I agree because yeah, I don't think I can handle this very well, but I think to start off talking about what the actual details, uh, obviously this is something Being run by Enterprises. It's not being sent out as a it's not being advertised. It's like a it's not a consumer level thing. So what they found were as we mentioned for issues. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to find my notes on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3781" class="timestamp">01:03:01</a><div class="content"> this, you know, bro.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3783" class="timestamp">01:03:03</a><div class="content"> There we go.

Really operates very weirdly to me.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3795" class="timestamp">01:03:15</a><div class="content"> It's more of like a password reset Vector.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3798" class="timestamp">01:03:18</a><div class="content"> Yeah, it doesn't make sense of why it's a password reset Vector though. So what happens is you've got this Albatross endpoints animal IDP selections selecting, whatever your identity provider is and it takes a username and a session ID in from the URL parameters and without doing anything else really just checks, you know is the username know or have Value the session ID known or not having value gives you an are and those cases. Tries to grab the user based on that username or gives you an error if I can't find it and just a so CH the session ID with the user and then redirects them to what I assumed was the proper sam'l IDP selection page because it basically ends of redirecting you to the outside of the albatross at first first parameter in like the directory structure redirects you outside of that to the same page sam'l IDP selection. Some might guess is a something like some old code or like a use actually do something here. Then they decide to make another page actually do that like not every service had to implement this or something and they just left this code in there. So I don't see why it's even setting the session ID with the user at this</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3876" class="timestamp">01:04:36</a><div class="content"> point.

It's probably old code.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3882" class="timestamp">01:04:42</a><div class="content"> Yeah. Well, that's kind of my feelings. Anyway, then you've got after that you you can make a call to user slash login still under Albatross and that will take the username and several other possibilities like a password or a session ID. So if you specify your session and the right session ID, it decides that he must be doing some sort of password reset or initial creation because it looks up the user in the user map. If it doesn't find it basically does the same thing though. It generates a new. Well, it grabs a uuid for the user and generates a new password for them in the one case. Basically like you do log in with the session ID and you get a new password out and then you could use that password to actually log in</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=3932" class="timestamp">01:05:32</a><div class="content"> it seems like it may be from like servicing like functionality that just wasn't stripped out in production or something.

But basically what this allows you to do is pass any parameters you want to end map which can include a script command and there's another endpoint that allows you to upload arbitrary files for patch files.

The final issue is a bit less impactful. It's maze it's basically a path traversal and the ability to fetch log files.

So you can just do a directory traversal and exfil any file.

Yeah fair enough. Wow, yeah, definitely fair, but when his powers don't don't agree with that still one report it, you know, make an attempt another way,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4275" class="timestamp">01:11:15</a><div class="content"> but the right route I think you know, he could have just dropped it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4278" class="timestamp">01:11:18</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I mean he does I find it. So I guess we'll just say this IBM basically rejected this out. There are common we have assessed this report and closed as being out of scope for vulnerability disclosure program since this product is only for enhanced support paid for by our customer. So I actually so it seems like basically it's you know pain. So my first thought actually was that perhaps this was end of life already. As far as I can tell it's not looking at their website. Like there's nothing that indicates to me that they don't support this anymore and you have to pay for the enhanced support for it seems like it's just, you know for their customers that are paying more. They actually kind of get something in there that said the hacker one doesn't seem to actually rule this out as far as I know from their scope. So I'm going to pull that up here. So the otoscope include some of the Stander things but in terms of like actual Products being El scope. It's either just end of support staff. So that's where I do feel like maybe this is like out of out of life because it does mention that IBM software that is reach end of support thus only people paying for the enhanced support.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4359" class="timestamp">01:12:39</a><div class="content"> Like do you get that?

You can still pay for support and windows will keep maintaining like I think they're still maintaining Windows XP. But only for those people that are paying quite a bit for that support. Yeah, so I think that could be the case that said there's nothing on their website that indicates that you can still get them to purchase this like there's nothing that indicates. It's not supported or anything like that that I could find on the actual website and the only other thing is IBM Cloud support report vulnerabilities found on my bluemix.net to use the IBM Cloud support for that otherwise off the issues are just like actual Who's that?

Yeah, so we have yet another project zero posts related to chromium which you know is pretty cool because the project zero guys are really smart and they do some really cool write-ups and this one is about a one-line change that was made in Windows 10 1903 which could allow a Sandbox escape and code execution in the GPU process of chromium. So they gave some really nice. Background to chromium sandboxing on Windows and some of the stuff they do so, you know, they disabled groups. They remove Integrity levels and they advert stricted access tokens or security identifiers or what they call SIDS and that's mainly enforce a few steps. I think the big one like the last line of defense is the colonel restricts what tokens can be assigned to unprivileged users in a new process the sandbox also restricts the ability to get suitable access tokens and they do so much. Our stuff like child process mitigation and stuff like that. But the the colonel enforcing the restriction on access tokens is kind of the critical point of failure here if that's broken, you know, the other ones are easier to get around kind of thing. The the one is like the bottom brick basically of the wall. So I mean you can you can guess what subsystem the vulnerability was introduced in it was in the kernel enforcement of the access tokens. So the one-line change Change they made if we scroll down a</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4736" class="timestamp">01:18:56</a><div class="content"> little so before you actually go with what the issue was. I do want to mention what's really important here. Is that basically when you create a new process so during the sandbox process and they talked a little bit about how their sandboxing works, but you have the access token A specter said they apply some restricted ssids to it. They end up restricting the actual process token itself. So what's to prevent your process from just being a new process that has a more permissive token and that's where this idea of child and sibling tokens come in when you create a token or sir when you create a process you should have its parent token should be like the process creating it then gets assigned as like being a child on the other hand though you could have a sibling token which has the same parent ID as The process creating it and no ID or an auth token is also included in there. So what ends up happening with this bug now is basically made it impossible to create the parent-child token. So would inherit all of those restrictions anymore out of the parent it would be treated as a sibling and that comes simply because rather than in the old case the code was new token the parent token ID field. Old would get the value of the oil token token ID. Basically, you know, the parents token gets tossed in as being the parent open ID exactly. What should be in this new with this one line change it took the old tokens parent token ID and set it as the parent Hogan ID of the new token. So that made it a sibling. It wasn't a child of the process that was creating it. It was a sibling to it which then meant that Basically, you could do everything that sibling could it was a sibling to any other desktop application rather than being a child in the sandbox?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4863" class="timestamp">01:21:03</a><div class="content"> But you can set it to like a service to get like all the permissions at that service does to I think</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4868" class="timestamp">01:21:08</a><div class="content"> well service to be</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4869" class="timestamp">01:21:09</a><div class="content"> use but I had thought I had it written down but I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4872" class="timestamp">01:21:12</a><div class="content"> don't yeah, so like the basic will be able to pass that check. So then you could set your token after you created this process to something else. Andy I don't recall offhand which one they did I really only figured that the interesting part here was this one line change. The rest of the article does go into actually doing the full sandbox escape and finding the right token expound to expose the taupe and all of that that they could use it does for if the bugs was just this one this one line change that essentially made it impossible to create the child token.

Yeah, it is a little bit weird, but overall I think what's the most value and this post isn't even the bug or the Escaping The Sandbox part. I think it's more the background information on the chromium sandbox because that's one thing that I found like in the past. I've tried to get a little bit of information about how to sandboxing works and browsers and stuff like that and there's just not a lot of good information out there about that and I think this post gives some good background of how it works at least on the Windows side. So it's going to be different for like Android and stuff like that. But on the window side you get that Insight of how it kind of interacts with Windows to do the sandbox restrictions. And I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=4981" class="timestamp">01:23:01</a><div class="content"> think that some people are kind of interested are interested in that there's actually Kind of fun the windows blog. There's some older posts. This is back from 2007, but it's very similar to what Chrome does it talks about something sandbox that was done for Microsoft Office in particular with like docx processing and stuff. But there's a series of posts here. I think it's yeah 3PO 3PO post bail practical Windows sandboxing goes into even more detail than what project zero does here, but the Chrome Is reasonably or fairly similar to this like it's almost based off of what was being done here. I don't know if there is some other Common Core. That they both derived from also but this is a good good write-up that will be in the documentation or they'll be in the description. Sorry.

But yeah, so I think we can move on to 0 click mail.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=5052" class="timestamp">01:24:12</a><div class="content"> Yep, and what's your click mail? This made a decent little bit of noise or waves this week. It's 0 click against the default mail application on iOS the bug has been around since at least iOS 6 it's 0 click when the mail application is opened in the background on iOS 13 on iOS 12. You do need to click the mail in order to trigger the attack and they don't include information about the earlier versions and how you might exploit it. Oh, the other thing was on 12 you do get 0 click if you control the mail server, which is a pretty high barrier when you're trying to attack. Somebody probably don't control their mail server. and okay wasn't showing up on my stream of so there are two ways. She's one of them was the one that was actually exploit. That's a remote Heap overflow. But the other one that they also discovered that was being attacked not necessarily. As use though both kind of come out of this MFM you are sorry MF mutable data type in the my library. So application type, you know, MF mutable data. I'm not familiar with it. But you can get an out of bounds right where? Factually, what would end up happening is as it would read data from the email. So if you send your email as as being that are having this mind type as a would read the data out. It would write to a file or write it to an M mapped. Location and so every time it would get a new chunk. It would call F truncate syscall that basically can be used spite the name being drunk Amy think make smaller. It would resize it in general. So with f trunk a it would get called and ideally you'd be adding extra memory onto the end of whatever the buffer was. So whatever size of the chunk add that memory with f truncate and then read and then write to it. What ended up happening though is if F trunk a failed it didn't care just kept going so you can kind of imagine what would happen. It doesn't actually extend the buffer. You keep writing out of bounds right plain and simple they don't talk about the actual exploitation. Mechanism. All they gave is kind of that little detail leading to the out of bounds, right? In a very similar way the MF mutable data the append data or a pain bites. function would also be used for Sorry, I'm getting two of the issues confused. So that's actually it was in the append data function where this one that I just talked about is where it kind of came from after okay would fail it would do the outer bounds, right? The remote Heap overflow was also in this MF mutable area of code in particular MFD a message content consumer. So again, this is downloading the email if you give it that mime type, it creates an NS mutable data, which calls a pen data on it. The NS mutable data has a threshold this time of 200,000 or hex teeth two hundred thousand bytes. So when you get larger than that writes it off to a file on and Maps into memory. What was interesting here rather than being the truncate that fails when it tried to get a large sure thing if you Sent an email that was large enough to exceed the ramp size or the remaining ramp. So basically large enough that it couldn't expand its size any further it would fail and when it would fail it would check for that failure. Actually the some DMF would fail it would check that and it would just do this block invoke which only would do an 8 byte allocation. so any data that you upended after that eight bytes are after larger than 8 bytes would be overwritten in the Heap so that's the exploit that was actually used or at least they were actually seeing me being exploited most often again they don't talk about the fool exploit just what the issues were that they saw</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=5331" class="timestamp">01:28:51</a><div class="content"> yes oh that was the most interesting part in What made it blow up right was it the it was found that it was being attacked in the wild yeah it wasn't just like issues they found while they were auditing or something like that and now it's too bad we don't have an t on because I noticed they have a list of some like really interesting targets that were suspected to be hit by this so you got like Fortune 500 organization like an individual's from those VIP from Germany a journalist in Europe.

So like the network service account. But I guess you were probably just about to go into that.

You have your network service first process on there's going to be our PCS</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=5600" class="timestamp">01:33:20</a><div class="content"> s. Well I think they try to invoke it because what what you see if you scroll down a little bit is they initially try? To get the running service for our PCS s and I think it's initially denied. But because it ends up getting access they end up getting that token. So then the next call to it through like, you know SMB or whatever ends up getting granted. I think that's how it works is a little bit confused and how its worded because it's a blog post. It's not like a full research thing. But</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=5632" class="timestamp">01:33:52</a><div class="content"> yeah, it's just an idea here.

Okay, that's how you say it. They're white paper name is a bit weird severity. So it basically talks about AMD secure encrypted virtualization technology, which is where the STD comes from. And that's a hardware back memory encryption which tries to prevent a malicious hose from being able to you know, steal data from your server. Yes. So control the control flow of it or</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=5853" class="timestamp">01:37:33</a><div class="content"> whatever to add in there SME is the secure memory encryption SCV. Is in particular has you're saying they're both the militias are compromised hypervisor trying to get information. So SMA is secure memory encryption that encrypts memory before it's being written to wrap. What SCV does is every VM should be getting its own SME key, so it should have its own encryption. And then also I cves or encrypted state will split kind of the VM State into two parts. So the VM State usually is unencrypted and contain sky like controller or the unencrypted control air contains information like flags that the VM my knee. It's information VM does need but also can contain like registered some information like that. It's the state effectively so though on Krypton they split it into two parts one just being the unencrypted stuff that the VM actually need to that stuff like that. I was mentioning and then that's a very that contains all the other information. A nation that gets encrypted stuff like that. Yeah that gets encrypted in a way that the hypervisor can't see it. or shouldn't be able to see it obviously though some operations do require the hypervisor to know things about the gas and the state and all of that so they introduced is the example one that they use yeah so there's the guest hypervisor communication block effectively it's a shared page at the guests in hypervisor can use and be like hey I need the hypervisor can be like hey I need this information and they guess we'll share it over that So anyway, so SCV is just like that encrypted State part. Talking about the actual attack here you'll notice in the tile. No security without integrity. Basically, so with until you've got a message or with like sgx, you've got a message authentication code that's stored with this encrypted memory so you can temper with it, but it does eat up extra memory because every block of memory you have also needs an auth code attached to it. So you're constantly eating up a little bit of extra memory because of encryption AMD you chose to go away with that and doesn't have a message authentication code. Therefore there's no Integrity guarantee. So even though the hypervisor can't read the data they can modify the data without being with him. Yeah, and so I'm actually going to call out one of our challenges off of zero X zero, five three nine dotnet And the reason why when I call that out is I wrote a challenge called crypto cookies. Yeah and crypto cookies. Its old name was actually a hmac question mark x x left can't talk today but others by the way, well, I'm going to talk about the type of issue that's there. Yes, but the gist of this one. is this of the crypto cookies attack is it's a crypto tact that relies on not having any authentication checks so you can start messing with what's there exactly what these guys kind of do so if you want to play around with this type of crypto attack this is at least an option for you to take a look at if you care to only seven solves so not a lot of people have but it's it's in my opinion of pretty basic crypto issue the SCV one here is a little bit more involved but the core idea is the same in this case and in the challenge case it's using ECB in the actual case here with SCV it's using X or and cryptex or so it has the key xor's the data encrypted xor is the data again man into actually little bit more involved than that yet to but but the gist of this is without the attend ocation existing on the crypto Oh, yeah, if you can know where your dad is going, like let's just say you can get a bunch of A's into memory. You can take that block of A's and you could go place it anywhere you want and memory and you know, that that contains a bunch of A's encrypted that's not very useful but you could say encrypt a string that become some x64 instructions for example, and then you can go in place that somewhere memory and code because this is talking about a compromise hypervisor so they can modify all the memory. They want that is important. They the hypervisor can change everything it just they don't have access to read anything to know what's actually there.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6150" class="timestamp">01:42:30</a><div class="content"> Like one way they do that because I found a kind of interesting is we mentioned cpuid earlier. They actually use that instruction to as like an Oracle and they basically write like a bunch of instructions or they actually sorry They smash a jump instruction that actually isn't a function that uses cpuid so that it breaks the loop so you can use that cpuid instruction to exfil data a like any you like dick. The data that you want I thought that was pretty cool. I just wanted to ship that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6180" class="timestamp">01:43:00</a><div class="content"> out. Yeah, and I mean so they also use like a side channel to track like guests execution to know where it is while executing using basically by setting the code pages to non-executable. Then obviously with the it when the VM tries to execute that page hypervisors want to know? Because I did some that would usually be hint. So they do talk about a few side channels for getting some information out that can be useful. But the gist of it is once if you're able to get some control over memory being encrypted you can do that and then move it around in memory effectively.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6221" class="timestamp">01:43:41</a><div class="content"> Yeah.

It's not just some week.

Though this one talks about everyone's favorite memory corruption use after free and try and prevent them in languages like C. And to do this their goal was to write their own memory allocator called Marcus which can mitigate use after fries with low overhead costs. That was their goal in the paper. And the way they do this. They just perform like a traversal of live memory</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6505" class="timestamp">01:48:25</a><div class="content"> regions. It's a garbage collector. I know they say they're not a garbage collector. It's a garbage collector. That's what they're doing. It's effectively marking well not quite markets wave like they do have some optimization specific tool but they do a live traversal finding any pointers that are making sure all of the pointers that should be free are</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6527" class="timestamp">01:48:47</a><div class="content"> free yeah I think the whole idea is like it's less bloated than your typical garbage collector and like you said they try to do those optimization so some of the stuff they do there to try reduce overhead as they only check objects which are allocated by the programmer so like stuff allocated by the C runtime for example is going to be checked which could be potentially a whole but you know that's kind of the performance trade-off there which that can significantly improve performance but basically what they do is when a pointer is freed they pass it to a quarantine list and then they check it before they allow memory to pass from the quarantine list to the actual free list it's kind of like an additional bucket for pointers to go into before they end up going to the actual free list</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6574" class="timestamp">01:49:34</a><div class="content"> yeah so one thing they do all still is they buffer it so they don't go and actually check until so kind of doing the world stopping check actually I'm not sure if this one was World stopping I think it's just live so never mind that but they don't don't do that check until there's enough memory that's going to be free to kind of make it worthwhile yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6599" class="timestamp">01:49:59</a><div class="content"> so like you said this is very similar to a garbage collector now there are a few issues I do have with this paper for one thing like you were saying the memory is check is happening live that sounds like it's very reasonable if you if you're talking about something like this in a kernel which this is not going in Colonel I'll make that clear right now I can almost guarantee it but if it were let's say hypothetically it was in a colonel or a browser or something like that which is multi-threaded that could almost certainly be raced because it's it's in software and if you tried to make it so you could recently if you did locking and everything around it probably incur such a ridiculous performance overhead that it would negate the entire purpose of this and the other thing is I think their performance benchmarks are a little bit weird they use spec CPU 2006 with a they had a Metroid overhead of like average 2.4% but I don't think that's a good</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6655"

looking at something like a personal you're going to be having a ton of allocations every second and the more allocations you have the slower this this alligator is going to be and that's where I see the problem is a lot of the stuff they're testing here I doubt many of these are doing a ton of allocations if you start looking at this in real world application or real-world applications that are

piece of software like a network service? How would this do it on like even nginx or Apache or as you know some runtime like that? I mean anything you've mentioned the Curtis but yeah, I like it.

Yeah, that was kind of my immediate thought was no no like it's are writing this. They would know what a good Benchmark would be see it does feel it feels very weird. That was the first thing I kind of noticed when I saw the results was sure. Okay, the result looks promising but the Benchmark Suite is just wrong in my opinion. Maybe they have more reason for but they didn't really give a lot of reason why why they chose spec.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6842" class="timestamp">01:54:02</a><div class="content"> yeah it seems like their evaluation section was very small compared to some of the other sections but you know that's just I'm not saying the paper is bad or anything there's probably some interesting stuff in there that's worth checking out but the actual overhead I would take with a big grain of salt I don't think it's I don't think it's accurate as an accurate representation</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6862" class="timestamp">01:54:22</a><div class="content"> so yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6864" class="timestamp">01:54:24</a><div class="content"> it would be cool if somebody could evaluate it in a more real-world context or something that would be something where you'd want to make sure that you don't have that overhead</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6876" class="timestamp">01:54:36</a><div class="content"> yeah I would completely agree on that yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6881" class="timestamp">01:54:41</a><div class="content"> so that concludes our research section will jump into some shoutouts our first one is actually on a bug we've talked about a little bit before I can't remember the exact episode number I don't know if you have that say oh no it's a it's an Android Bluetooth 0 click rce</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6896" class="timestamp">01:54:56</a><div class="content"> yeah so I just want to call this one I was like Spector said we have talked about this before I believe it was episode 28 where we talked with us and we looked at what the bug was all ready for this but I think somebody link this on our Discord so I figured I would at least kind of call it out but we've already talked about the actual XY here we've looked at the patch this blog posts actually goes a little bit into the fuzzing and how they kind of discovered it I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6923" class="timestamp">01:55:23</a><div class="content"> mean the fact that we built our own like emulator called Frankenstein for it which I thought was kind of cool</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6928" class="timestamp">01:55:28</a><div class="content"> yeah the fuzzing itself was basically just by flipping if I recall correctly and wasn't anything too crazy but it's so they kind of go into what they did there like there's a lot of extra information that is in the so figured we'd kind</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/0NS8tgeid9M?t=6940" class="timestamp">01:55:40</a><div class="content"> of Call that out. Yeah, I think the I read it and some of the cool stuff was around the mem copy mostly because if you look at the bug originally it's basically doing a negative size to mem copy which went mem copy takes a nun size onion unsigned sighs. So negative size is really just going to be a very large size which typically isn't very easy to exploit because you know, if you try to write like 2 billion bytes or something you're going to end up. Up hitting unmapped a memory and you're going to crash and that's not what you want. If you want to exploit something unless you just care about a denial of service, but they kind of talk about some weird quirks with mem copy that they found and I forget exactly like why but there was a reason where if you pass something like negative 2 it would actually only end up copying like 64 bytes. I think it was basically it wouldn't copy more than the gap between the source and the destination or something like that. It was kind of weird it wasn't that part was a bit weird to me they didn't explain it too much but it was it was just like some weird quirks and mem copy that kind of it was cut it was pretty cool because it showed a typically unexplainable issue or something that would be very hard to exploit and how they kind of forced it and worked around it to make it an exploitable issue which is something that's like really cool to see an exploitation it's why exploitation is kind of an art you got to have to take something and keep playing with it and playing with it until you manage to find a way that works and that's kind of what this blog post demonstrates that's why it's a I think it's a good shout</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

two different companies but um yeah I mean we like talking about hypervisor stuff it's always fun to look at it's kind of like that dark magic aspect that but it's so low level that not many people look at it but I'm not like neither zi rui are too familiar with Windows and stuff like that so I didn't I don't think we could really cover it and do it justice very well so that's why it's more of a shed out than like a research topic but I think it could be like very interesting to viewers out there so we</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

patch guard is detecting introspection by the hypervisor so try to detect when the hypervisor is being loaded malicious trying to patch it trying to change things whatever it just a few tricks that are used to do that or that Microsoft's using to do that I just don't think I know enough to really be able to summarize these tricks very well that's so you can read that and kind of get that information yeah it looks that's it is two parts well have a link to both in the description but yeah it's definitely an interesting read but goes a little bit</div></div><div class="line"><div

but it was obviously canceled because of all the craziness happening around the world right now but they they ended up doing a live stream called the lockdown livestream so while the conference wasn't happy they did have some presentations going on live stream so you can still check them out they did like a virtual conference kind of so I thought that was really cool they did they did it on the 24th I think this is day one they do have two up so they have like a little playlist actually on the same page on the right side if you see there they have a playlist of all the live streams that they did so yeah I think that might be of interest to viewers out there there might be some cool Topics in there I think we'll probably be an end up seeing more conferences do this we could eat even end up seeing Defcon do like a virtual live stream for toxic would have been presented there because I don't see the stuff going away anytime soon</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi"

didn't get a chance to watch them I actually just noticed the live streams being up a day or two ago I was a bit late on it but I probably will end up you know at least skimming through it and see if there's any toxic or interesting because you know some of these conferences do have some really interesting talk so I could see one here already like about five and a half hours and that's about fuzzing and it looks like it's Colonel fuzzing because they're talking about just call so that looks like it could be an interesting talk that I might want to check out but yeah I think that pretty much summarizes all of our shoutouts I will mention again that I'll be doing a live stream at some point this week looking at realize and I don't know how much I'll be comparing it to I don't want to

the vods on Twitch or on YouTube 24 hours after the stream we also have previous podcasts up on Spotify Apple podcasts Google podcasts and we have an anchor link that has them all kind of collated there like I said I'll be doing a stream at some point this week probably tomorrow on looking at realize you can also join our Discord or follow us on Twitter if you want to get involved in the community but yeah we'll be back that's Monday at the same time 3:00 p.m. Eastern 4 p.m. Pacific</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a
