Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me a zi as well as anti because the anti is with us. We're going to be front loading the podcast with some of the more threat Intel related topics. So we'll jump right into those because anti he's not going to be with us for the full episode is going to be with us for about probably like 20 or 30 minutes or so. I'm guessing so we'll just we'll jump into the first topic he wanted to bring up which is cognizant suffering maze ransomware cyber attacks. So anti would you be able to jump into that one? Because I haven't really I didn't get a chance to look at that one too much did it some other topics but I know you wanted to bring this one up. So I'll let you jump into it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=58" class="timestamp">00:00:58</a><div class="content"> Yeah, give me one second to pull up the link here is having a little bit technical issues. But yeah, so the maze ransomware for anyone who's not aware of what this is why it matters. So maze ransomware is one of the groups that is pretty prolific right now. They're one of the first groups that Equally, once they hit you with ransomware, they would post your company's information on their little website and then force you to pay because all your information is exposed. Right? So it's it's another type of ransomware. They don't just encrypt everything but they also publish it until you pay them. So what's fascinating is they've actually spawned a whole bunch of recent ransomware variants that like have caused, you know them to change their way of thinking so things like the limb and empty. I'm sure these all sound like archaic names to some people but Actually, it's kind of changed the business model of how ransomware is working at present. So maze ransomware recently hit organization called cognizant. I believe about use them. So but I know that they're pretty large and so I thought it was fascinating to see that even these like huge kind of it organizations that no matter how many preparations you have in place, right especially for an organization that manages other people's infrastructure, you know the risk of being hit by something like ransomware as pretty steady and you know you Guys kind of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=137" class="timestamp">00:02:17</a><div class="content"> so I actually I want to bring up question with that. It seems to me like the standing recommendation has generally been to just pay the ransom Ware that runs more generally at least like, you know, you pay it you do get your content decrypt and you're good to go it has that been true or am I misinformed</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=157" class="timestamp">00:02:37</a><div class="content"> so it's a little bit of both, right? You know, like because I thought the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=162" class="timestamp">00:02:42</a><div class="content"> FBI. Yeah. I thought the FBI had given the advice is just simply just At</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=168" class="timestamp">00:02:48</a><div class="content"> yeah, they definitely so you'll hear like the info seconds tribute. Like don't pay them you're paying criminals and so on but the FBI yet, they've admitted that basically what are you going to do? Right? So yes realistically if you want your information decrypt it is going to you're going to have to likely pay most of these ransomware variants people haven't figured out like it's just incription, you know what I mean? So it's secure and it's sense that the way they're going about it usually would like two sets of keys. You're not going to be able to like decrypt that content yourself and the the hard part is, you know, Even a third party company like they talked to the threat actors or whatever the hell you want to come for you. It doesn't change the fact that you're craps encrypted. So, you know the hardest part actually that most people deal with is not even paying for it because it's trivial for multi, you know hundreds of millions of dollars a company entrance that much it's actually that like the decryption itself right takes like months because it's slow and they're usually pretty crappy. So that's the caveat. Is that even if you pay them and you're losing like I've known some organizations lose like three to five million Day because everything is encrypted. It doesn't you know, it doesn't the sad part is even if you pay it it still takes two months your now losing, you know, in excess of you know hundreds of millions of dollars you have an if you pay the fair</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=239" class="timestamp">00:03:59</a><div class="content"> point on that. I was more wondering if it was really necessary to publish the information to encourage payment because it seemed to me as somebody that hasn't been you know impacted by ransomware haven't been involved with company that's been impacted by ransomware. It seemed to me like generally they they were paying it. So you didn't need further encouragement to pay so just seemed like that that extra step just seems unnecessary to me.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=264" class="timestamp">00:04:24</a><div class="content"> I think it's because nowadays like you get some organizations that will go and publicly say like I'm not going to pay this right. So it's more of an incentive that if you want the trouble to stop like this group specifically maze I'd have to pull up their website right now, but they have it where there's a group that they think is compromised January that refused to pay right and even though they refuse to pay this group. May's group has still continued to kind of trash talk and tell them that like, you know, this group doesn't care and that you know, that made it a point that it doesn't just go away because you don't offer to pay the whole reason for that is to continue to post your information and you know, the legality of it of having that information out there kind of puts you in a weird spot, right?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=304" class="timestamp">00:05:04</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I could see where you know definitely adds a pressure and I could understand company that decides not to pay. I mean, it's similar, you know with paying for a kidnapping since you're paying the criminals. You're basically just encouraging the action further.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=319" class="timestamp">00:05:19</a><div class="content"> It's kind of like that. But associate with terrorists, yeah. Oh,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=323" class="timestamp">00:05:23</a><div class="content"> yeah. No, I mean you're right and idea that it honestly, like does it make a big difference your stuff's going to be encrypted one way or another probably not but I think the different ideas that they give them like two weeks to go and say if you don't want this in the news and blahbitty blah, well then just pay us now, right? Otherwise, that's when you see them publish it so then you don't just have two bad guys to worry about right you've now got the stress of media Outlets who wait for stuff like To happen harassing you you've got researchers and every single person annoying the crap out of you and when they publish it like most ransomware groups, if they're you know, just trying to stay low down they'll just encrypt the information right and then kind of annoys you about it to decrypt it if they have like these groups are taking that information as well. So then you run the risk of Bill now give it to all the other criminals, right?</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=368" class="timestamp">00:06:08</a><div class="content"> Yeah. No, I definitely see where like a match. I definitely see where the pressure is coming from on that side. Like I see what's novel about this. This it was just kind of had that question about you know, it's a really necessary and I guess 0.2 go. Yeah, it does make a practical difference against those companies that might try and stand up to it a little</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=388" class="timestamp">00:06:28</a><div class="content"> bit. Yeah, now that's that's kind of my you know synopsis really is just that I thought that this was interesting because of the fact that like I know lots of people talk about ransomware and stuff and kind of understand how it works, but I don't know. I just thought it was like old-school gangster type stuff where it's like, okay, I'm not just going to encrypt all your crap. Like I'm going to make it known that I've encrypted all your stuff and your clients are going to hate like, you know, it's just for</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=414" class="timestamp">00:06:54</a><div class="content"> protection, you know going with that protection racket of the mafia.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=420" class="timestamp">00:07:00</a><div class="content"> If you let your neighbors know that I broke your windows and I fixed them to and if they don't want an Ali.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=428" class="timestamp">00:07:08</a><div class="content"> One thing I did notice just scrolling down the page a little bit is you know, they're saying that it should be treated as a data breach because there is an encrypted files being stolen. So like does that mean technically that under gdpr any companies that operate in Europe have to disclose when they're hit by ransomware now, like I never really liked I know gdpr is kind of a weird topic because it's pretty</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=453" class="timestamp">00:07:33</a><div class="content"> vague, even if they weren't even if the files were being taken. I think just the fact that they would have been X or whooping access by the malware doing the encryption would be enough to Warrant the data breach</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=466" class="timestamp">00:07:46</a><div class="content"> alert. Okay. Yeah, it was just something that I never really thought about it like obviously but you know if this is dumped on the on the web or something then that constitutes a data breach but just like it's a breach when it's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=478" class="timestamp">00:07:58</a><div class="content"> accessed. So what exactly happens from there, you know, it takes time to figure out what exactly happens in attack figure out what was actually taken in South bow the moment</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=489" class="timestamp">00:08:09</a><div class="content"> it's access its breached.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=492" class="timestamp">00:08:12</a><div class="content"> At least as far as I know obviously, I'm not a lawyer. We're not lawyers on here. But she's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=497" class="timestamp">00:08:17</a><div class="content"> providing. Will your advice right now? That's what</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=499" class="timestamp">00:08:19</a><div class="content"> yes, that's that's how you can take this run your company based off of my advice. I would highly recommend it. But yeah, as far as I'm aware of GDP are as soon as that axis happened it sort of breaks and we've kind of seen that with well with that shot off. I think we talked about a few episodes back. That one shop that got compromised and the white hat hacker who was acting fairly dark was kind of trying to leverage that saying they needed to disclose the breach because because he had access regardless of the fact that he had made a public yet. Did you have anything further to kind of add on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=542" class="timestamp">00:09:02</a><div class="content"> that? The only thing I would say is that you know to throw a little shade I think talking about gdpr and certain things. I'm not saying that companies aren't reporting it. But I do get this feeling that you know, because I've looked into some of these compromises and stuff like that. I'm very comfortable saying that there's probably some companies who aren't reporting like they're supposed to I can't name and shame because I don't know for sure. I think there's no hard to fix. Aren't necessarily aware yet. They need to be reporting all the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=572" class="timestamp">00:09:32</a><div class="content"> time or of was level they need a report at and that's not an excuse. It is one of the things I appreciate with GPR is I do think you know companies need to be more responsible about disclosing when informations been breached. So like I agree with GDP are kind of pushing that although I do realize it adds a little bit extra work for like the small businesses and stuff, but Yeah, I definitely agree. There are there are going to be companies that aren't necessarily alerting on the base of a breach part of that's going to come down to being able to detect the breach small business isn't necessarily going to have the same skills to actually detect. Hey, they've been breached. I do think this is an interesting case because they you were mentioning about it taking months to decrypt if it's taking months to decrypt. It's probably taking a while to encrypt all so they're probably sitting on there for a while this particular. Page from bleeping computer mentions that attackers were likely on the network for weeks.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=631" class="timestamp">00:10:31</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and I don't wanna interrupt Specter. I know he probably had some say so if you want to throw your hat into the mix real quick Specter, I did have a response to that though. Zi.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=638" class="timestamp">00:10:38</a><div class="content"> Okay. What I just wanted to say was with the GDP our Point specifically even though it technically Viola GDP are not disclosing if these kinds of breaches happen. The problem is how much is it actually enforced? You know, I don't have the data laid out for that, but I Imagine they're probably not really aggressively enforcing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=658" class="timestamp">00:10:58</a><div class="content"> us. So actually gdpr does have some bite. I couldn't I wasn't expecting a name any particular instances, but there have been some significant fines around gdpr. So I would say that it does have a bite. Okay Fern I couldn't say in particular sure because I mean there's also the case of if they don't alert that there's a bridge how do you even find out that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=679" class="timestamp">00:11:19</a><div class="content"> there was a breach</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=680" class="timestamp">00:11:20</a><div class="content"> I mean depending on the type of criminals that actually did the bridge they're not necessarily going to be dumping it or how it gets you. Is might not be clear. So I mean, I'm sure there are companies that can get away without reporting because the criminals just have to kind of keep it quiet. They had the data from this Source or you couldn't actually isolate what the source of the information was.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=700" class="timestamp">00:11:40</a><div class="content"> Yeah. Now that's probably a fair point and I think you know, I mean, it does have a little bit of bite, you know, if you look at Facebook and I think even Google have been sued based on GDP are or find I should say not suit the find based on those. So I mean it does have an impact now. Like you kind of talked about Specter how big of an impact again a mom and pop shop. Are you going to go drag him through the mud and stabbed him in the leg like how dare you know, like, you know, who knows how deep it really goes if it's not a big big company, but you know to kind of summarize on one point Z, it does happen that most of these campaigns and once that I've even seen, you know, it doesn't just happen overnight like oh no, you know, I went and walked away for coffee and my whole network isn't Clint completely encrypted like it. Isn't to my knowledge. I haven't seen anything like that. But the problem is usually a lot of these companies, you know, just I think even there's a I don't know if stop my head maybe I can provide a link there was some government agency. I think of something with the power grid in South America that basically like gigabytes if not terabytes of information was siphoned out and stuff like that. So all these people don't have any cognizant idea of like the initial state which is usually the loader right? So these things start with like a very basic malware, Are not necessary basic but one that's just meant to drop more malware, right? So trick bought and a few other variants then it kind of sets and Scopes out the network then it's like multi stage is where they go and run things. Like I don't know if it was Powershell Empire, but there's definitely a few things like Cobalt strike some of the stuff that like pentesters use they'll go and like compromise all kinds of other servers and active directory and stuff like that to get as much access as they can. So normally it probably takes about a week but they have there has been some research that I've shown like some of these campaigns the second they get a foothold through like Like RDP or something. It'll take them like 48 hours to map out your network and then drop like something like Ryu quic then just encrypts everything so long story short. Usually if you have really good liquid setup, you can maybe catch this in the early stages, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to matter and malware just I me and that's kind of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=823" class="timestamp">00:13:43</a><div class="content"> a wider issue in general. There's a little bit of once you're through the perimeter. There's just trust trust everybody that's kind of inside the perimeter and that's a mistake. I think for a lot of companies that have that type of network setup, but that generally Wide what? It is, especially on smaller side, once you're in you're in and then you kind of just have maybe they're you know zi mention 80 and stuff. But like maybe there's a little bit more access control, but it's very soft once you're inside. But I think I do want to get on to the other topic before you have to take off. So if you're good with you, but go ahead. Let's hear it. Yeah. Well, so the other topic is the well potentially here from Vice hackers are selling a critical Zoom. Zero-day exploit for $500,000</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=870" class="timestamp">00:14:30</a><div class="content"> zooming back into the news.

First of all, it sounds like some of these require you to be on the call with some I so it's not like corporate Espionage or you're going to secretly get on the call.

There's that centralized patch if they patch On the server. It's patch</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=969" class="timestamp">00:16:09</a><div class="content"> for everybody pretty much,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=973" class="timestamp">00:16:13</a><div class="content"> you know, if it's client-side. Okay, maybe takes a little while. There's on my updates. So the lifespan of those excellent just doesn't last that long now to be fair. There's definitely a chance that prices are being pushed up just because everybody's all of a sudden using Zoom. So like I don't have like the Hands-On knowledge actually say, but I'm definitely skeptical the 500,000 price tag.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=996" class="timestamp">00:16:36</a><div class="content"> See part of the reason I could see the only reason I could see it maybe being even close to worth that much is because we have you know, as we've talked about in the past. We have seen governments using it. Like I think the UK government was using it for a little while, but that being said due to all the zoom issues that we have covered in the past as well. We've been seeing governments actually being recommended to and moving away from using Zoom as well. So while it has gained popularity, I think it's starting to lose some of that popularity, especially in the Like potential targets that you want to hit with spending that much money on it. I can see it maybe being closer to like Fifty to a hundred K. But 500k seems like way</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1035" class="timestamp">00:17:15</a><div class="content"> outlandish. It really does. I mean even so I can't think of too many other companies that will advertise the price that they're buying exploits at beside 0 DM. Yeah 0 DM like their web stuff like generally anything that's touching on the web. They're paying you know up to like 10,000 dollars for Stuff hitting the web that includes compromising like the mail servers in particular. Well, no the mail you I guess technically because it's round Cuban hoard that they're paying for.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1065" class="timestamp">00:17:45</a><div class="content"> I was going to say the only thing when you like zero teams are pretty good Baseline, the only things you're looking at and the 250 to 500 K range is either all server Tech or browser and mobile rces.

So I mean I could see why I like somebody really desperate for Zoom thing might pay more. That's why I said because there's that could be pushing the prices off but just using kinda the knowledge that we have. I was here damn in 0 DM is gray market and ugly. It's not black market pricing, but that's kind of the other thing when you're talking about the government the government's usually buying great Market as far as I'm aware. I'll know if anti if you want to correct me on that. But I believe the government's usually going to buy from brokers who are going to buy kind of on the gray Market.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1126" class="timestamp">00:18:46</a><div class="content"> Yeah, normally so the way it works in my understanding in this is In fairness. I'm not a government, you know that bias exploits. So please don't, you know quote me on this book to my understanding and people have talked with the government normally. Yes buys from like third-party so that there's less of a risk, right so that if I go I could say normally they don't buy to like zi rhodium or be zero day initiative. I don't think zi zi offers that but yeah, they go through a third party that then we'll go and find actually those things on their behalf that whole point so that they can kind of even distance themselves more. There's a whole reason that you have to go through all these like compliance checks and crap for selling to the government. So I assume you know for the most part. Yeah, they're not going just straight to the the hackers and stuff.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1169" class="timestamp">00:19:29</a><div class="content"> Yeah.

It's got to be worth like double that in the underground or some nonsense. You're like actually Lee I usually find that it's worth less in the underground because it's not like most cybercriminals dude or spending $500,000 for next week. That's insane. They can't make that much money. But if they can make that much money back like it would never be for something that has this little utility. You know what I mean? There's no full chain. There's there's it's only working for you. No one platform like and they didn't even talk about what like which versions of Windows which versions of Zoom so like I don't see most of these things. Even when there was some supposed went with exploits right rces. I was seeing them being offered at like 50k and craziness like that. Whereas there obviously worth a lot more than exploit broker stuff. So</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1250" class="timestamp">00:20:50</a><div class="content"> yeah, I think it's definitely great with you like my experience with the black market</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1254" class="timestamp">00:20:54</a><div class="content"> which has been limited but</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1256" class="timestamp">00:20:56</a><div class="content"> is that it's generally offering less not more unless you have something very very particular.

So even though it's valued at less you could potentially be making more money in the end because you're selling the more people but because you're selling the more people that bug is probably going to dial up faster too. So I think that's like one of the bigger differences between the gray Market in the black market generally in the gray market, like if if you sell to like zi rhodium or something like that. They're going to want exclusive access. To that, you know, they're not going to want you to go sell that to another exploit though. I gently</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1298" class="timestamp">00:21:38</a><div class="content"> 0 DM themselves and they do they sell they don't sell it exclusively.

Whereas when you're selling it on the black market. I think there's less of that exclusivity. So while it's true you are selling it like it's valued at less you are potentially making more but it's probably gonna die faster too. So that's why I think that's partially why governments probably Don't even touch the black markets. It's because they want that exclusivity.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1328" class="timestamp">00:22:08</a><div class="content"> Yeah, it's in Chad Razzie.

I mean, yeah, this isn't really about Zoom user awareness because this isn't going to impact most users of zoo. Anybody that's buying an X like $500,000 isn't just targeting the user base at Large. So it's definitely not just about alerting people to the fact that their Zoom. Oh days out there in terms of I mean Vice.

I'm not like some experience exploiter with doing like any sort of industrial Espionage, but I can't like I'd want to see something that could be used more for a spying.

So I mean, there's no point I think in talking about everything that he found what I thought was interesting though was this is fairly consistent with what LastPass has put out in the past. So one of the big issues with LastPass is you kinda have to trust what they say in their white paper what they saying their documentation is actually what they're doing. And of course you can go and validate that by looking, you know, in this case it how the command line interface actually works how that's all for works out generating the passwords how it's using them what it's sending all of that you can go and do that. So this is somebody that has gone and done that has documented the process and while he doesn't don't think he doesn't call it out, but it was fairly consistent with what last past has put on that's just the positive sign. With LastPass is actually doing what they claim to be doing. And I also just wanted to call if there's definitely misunderstanding as to how these</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1779" class="timestamp">00:29:39</a><div class="content"> cloud-based password managers</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1781" class="timestamp">00:29:41</a><div class="content"> work. I won't drop any names in particular, but I remember being on another twitch stream and the guy just meant like, you know, if you're letting the cloud know all your passwords or something. You're just doing it wrong. There's it was something like that where you basically had the idea that password managers actually knew what your passwords or and how LastPass Works how be awarded Works how basically any of the cloud or centralized storage password managers work any of the big ones, at least I'm so I'm sure there's some random one that's just implemented stupidly. But they don't know all of your information. They encrypt they basically just store this encrypted blob that is only decrypted on your side. They have separate keys to do your authentication to authenticate the you're allowed to see that blob versus being able to actually decrypt The Blob the keeps guys split up into three parts stored in different places. And you're the only one that actually brings them together with your master password. That's kept local of long story short. Basically this what I thought His interest here is just he found you know, a lot of consistency with what we've been informed about and in theory, this is somebody else. I'll say if you really want to trust you have to go look yourself, but this does seem to be kind of somebody independent coming to the same conclusions about how it's working what it's doing and just generally a positive sign. It does mention, you know reverse engineering he starts with the source code of L pass. So it was kind of thing. It's not reverse engineering sing. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean that wasn't really the aspect I cared but I just want to point this out of something that it's got the consistency there. Like I'm a fan of these cloud-based password managers. I completely get why you would want to take it a step further and store it and use like a key pass or something, you know, not use the cloud based system completely fair, but the biggest concern are people re using passwords.

So even you know, there is that idea that a master password if somebody can break your LastPass account. They do get all your other passwords, which could be a concern but</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1938" class="timestamp">00:32:18</a><div class="content"> that's a concern though</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1939" class="timestamp">00:32:19</a><div class="content"> way the duel off as well because you can Can attach things like a yubikey to it if you want, I think that might only be available to LastPass premium, but you do get access to some of those other more secure authentication methods as well with password managers, which I think is</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=1953" class="timestamp">00:32:33</a><div class="content"> yeah. There's always the risk though that last pass itself will be compromised and those votes will be leaked which you know aren't protected like you there's no way to kind of add the MFA to the Vault itself. Like that's kind of added by LastPass are browned making the request to get the vault. Yeah, so there's always that chance that something like that happens. And that's why just how they start the fact they don't actually store it. Like how the keys I'll work how they can't actually get corrupted themselves cat three thousand nine touches on what I was just saying and I salute for passwords is keepass with encrypted database and a Dropbox or clout and I mean I get why people do that. There's a convenient to aspect to using LastPass to using some of the other systems. I agree though, like using keepass is going to be you know, it is an extra step of security. It's also an extra step of work more talking about kind of getting everybody in the masses using it. Something like LastPass is far more convenient than being to make sure you always have that encrypted database around. That's said that is still a better step. I'll but at this point, I don't think the world's ready for that to be the default recommendation. It's not that I disagree with that recommendation. But I mean you're basically you're deciding that you know how to store that encrypted database better than LastPass who it's basically their whole goal is storing those fault among other</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Anti" class="author">Anti</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2042" class="timestamp">00:34:02</a><div class="content"> things.

I want to make that you know, like there's lots of good hacky Solutions you can do, you know, like you can encrypt it put it on USB dig and on to your house and stuff like that, but you know kind of like what you're talking about. I think it's the convenience, you know, if you want to get like a regular users to actually use these things and not using no hacker 13 as their password over and over and over again, you know, this is really the only solution I think that works for normal people but But you know, I think it's good that like actually see people like this are you know, testing out all the tools available, you know to this type of thing because you never know who's going to be using what right, you know, if they use the CLI only</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2085" class="timestamp">00:34:45</a><div class="content"> yeah. Well, so I think part of this is so you can kind of use LastPass embedded in another application pretty much as a library. Yeah. It's taking us Library. I imagine last passes didn't release it as a library pretty explicitly to try and prevent that from happening. Obviously. I think they knew They could have totally prevent that but I'm going to guess somewhere in their terms. It probably does this allow a kind of fronting like a or Y washing LastPass is your own service,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2116" class="timestamp">00:35:16</a><div class="content"> which doesn't kind of interesting why they would make that command line tool open source, if they didn't really want that I guess just for the transparency asked.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2124" class="timestamp">00:35:24</a><div class="content"> Well.

So the first one is the blog post from the devs and talking about hit it Benja 2.0 hitting Dev and what kind of things are dropping with it as well as the H LL or the decompiler, which we'll talk about next but there's some notable things dropping that like outside of the decompiler as well that they mentioned in this blog post. So a few of those are they're releasing an official plugin for debugging so they have some screenshots showing, you know, they're debugging front end. They have the register View and all that kind of stuff.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2203" class="timestamp">00:36:43</a><div class="content"> So, I believe they've already released this plug-in whether or not it's been Usable, yeah. Yeah, that's what I was saying. But yeah, it's been released it is kind of available there.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2216" class="timestamp">00:36:56</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and then some of the other like notable things they've dropped is a merge tool for collaboration and a new xref panel, which is really awesome. That is one one of my biggest gripes with binary ninja when I was using it last was the cross-references panel was kind of annoying to work with I think like you couldn't even really pop it out before and it was all just it was very simplistic and and basic you couldn't really get too much information out of it. But their new one that they're doing. Let me just go back to what the new one that they're doing actually has like a lot of information. It has the the type information in there and it talks about if it's a data reference or code reference. So I really like that new crop cross-references view. I think that's probably like that's that's personally something that I've been looking forward to so, you know, I don't know if I really use a debugging front end, but I know there are people who You know, that was one of the biggest things where people didn't want to switch from Ida the binary ninja or Deidre for example, is that fact that Ida has the debugger and benjin Deidre don't yeah. I mean, it's definitely like that arguments kind of disappear.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2280" class="timestamp">00:38:00</a><div class="content"> It's a consistency thing to like if you just kind of you get used to having the one environment where you're able to do everything, I mean, there are there is a nice part of that. We're having it built into wood because I assume with the plug and eventually we are going to be able to swap out. What the back Back end debugger actually is or perhaps you can do that. Now. I have not use the debugger yet. That'll be a big thing where you can use remote debug servers start debugging stuff and other things and just nice to have that convenient like the same interface cross everything rather than being too kind of like hack things together. I get why people want that? I don't know. I know</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2322" class="timestamp">00:38:42</a><div class="content"> for me personally look into to just like if you can Implement like, you know a custom debugger back. And stuff like that. I feel like the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2330" class="timestamp">00:38:50</a><div class="content"> odds are they'll get to the point where you know, it's pretty easy to swap that out. If it's not already easy to do</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2336" class="timestamp">00:38:56</a><div class="content"> that. Yeah, the main reason I think that would be interesting just for me personally is where I work on PS4 stuff that could be like a really cool plug-in to do is like a PS4 debugger through Benja, but it could be useful for like other iot stuff too.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2350" class="timestamp">00:39:10</a><div class="content"> So looks like they do mention using G DB server. So then that means anything that implements a to be service should be usable I imagine. Makes sense. So at least that far is good. I don't know what I don't know what they're using on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2365" class="timestamp">00:39:25</a><div class="content"> windows. So I was going to say it sounds like there has to be something for Windows because that is a pretty big user</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2370" class="timestamp">00:39:30</a><div class="content"> base. Yeah, so I'm going to assume they already have support for various debuggers. Actually. I just I don't see it explicitly listen listed here. But I would have to assume they've already got</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2383" class="timestamp">00:39:43</a><div class="content"> that know how they have like window bug support or something like that. But yeah, well, we'll have to see but yet not too much to talk about there, but it is cool just to see that it's not only the decompiler dropping but there is also the debugger dropping at the same time, which is like two of the major things that binges needed for a while. So, you know talking about the decompiler will jump into that as well. So played CTF was happening over the weekend and Vector 35 actually teamed up with them did like a little collaboration. Ocean and they dropped the decompiler on the dev Branch just in time for played CTF and I think they also gave away eight commercial licenses to the winning team of played CTF as well. I'm surprised you haven't jumped in yet Incorrect and me because I know it's probably supposed to be plaid CTF.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2426" class="timestamp">00:40:26</a><div class="content"> But yeah, well we were talking we already talked about that before the show, so I didn't think break head up here that said yeah eight gave it away, but it is on cloud and I want to mention right up front there is A little bit of an issue with the cloud one versus what you get with the actual product while he get with the paid when I did notice a couple differences there and I think we're going to kind of jump into what this decompiler is actually like so I think that's kind of some that matters here. I was definitely excited to see hli all being dropped. Oh,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2461" class="timestamp">00:41:01</a><div class="content"> I didn't expect that this soon.

So I'm not entirely surprised that said I will say this drop like it did give me to go and buy a commercial license another big part of that was Ida home complete disappointment. I just want to put my money behind a company that's actually trying to Improve the state of things rather than just kind of being the status quo nonetheless, you know, let's talk about the decompiler. I'll know my initial thoughts just really simple initial thoughts. I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't insanely impressed, but I wasn't</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2508" class="timestamp">00:41:48</a><div class="content"> disappointed. Okay. So I mean there I've seen a few gripes about the binary ninja decompiler. One of them is State they went with a weird choice of just using strict indentation python style and not using any braces for code block. You</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2523" class="timestamp">00:42:03</a><div class="content"> know what I hate that right though. So, yeah, so I'm actually going to pull up a screen shot from the decompiler here or well a few screenshots that I</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2533" class="timestamp">00:42:13</a><div class="content"> have. Okay, while you're doing that. I will say that wasn't the only one the other one was the variable naming the Variable naming people find pretty weird and unintuitive just the way that it's like VAR underscore. I guess I too like x-rays kind of does the same thing but like going 18 underscore one like they kind of just keep a pending these indexes on to it and it's kind of hard to follow that being said, I don't know like I can't really yeah Center Solution on the spot, but that is one other, you know complaint I saw that was common across different</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2566" class="timestamp">00:42:46</a><div class="content"> jae-min. I believe the 18 is the offset like when it's far. Or it's the offset on to the stack for where that was kind of like the first time it's initialized. So like there is some reasoning behind it. I believe that said when we're talking so I pulled up the screenshot. This is from Rob emporiums Bad characters challenge. Somebody actually on the re Discord server kind of pointed pointed out some other things with that particular challenge that'll bring up but in terms of the code block, so you'll see here that Don't use curly braces around anything. They just do indentation. So so I can understand why people are like, oh, I don't like that code style. You're not writing this code though. You're only going to read it. And the reality is that adding those braces is purely because this isn't see. I mean there's other things. I've make this Nazi you're not writing this your only need to read at the only thing that those braces will add is empty lines. That's the only thing it adds. So I would rather, you know, just like reading the disassembly it's usually fairly concise and all right there. Those braces only are going to be adding empty lines that don't actually add any meaning.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2646" class="timestamp">00:44:06</a><div class="content"> I think it's just one of those things where people want to be familiar with like they do equate decompiler with like see like output so they expect to see that and when it's not there just kind of makes them a bit uncomfortable. Yeah. No. No, I can't I don't really agree with that like ripe either. I don't think the braces are too important of a</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2662" class="timestamp">00:44:22</a><div class="content"> yeah. I didn't even notice it actually so I noticed that with one case where it was like an if statement because I've mentioned that's one of my pet peeves doing if statements without braces around it like one liner without Braces around it. Yeah, we had a little discussion about that. I noticed was that I didn't even go and look they're using it elsewhere though. It wasn't till somebody else pointed it out that I even noticed that it was doing that. Um that said other gripes one of the big things if you notice some we've got the two for loops and then if statement zi X Cube brackets zi x dot d bracket star bracket, those all those resizes actually. I think I have a better. Picture of that</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2706" class="timestamp">00:45:06</a><div class="content"> does basically saying zero extended quads or</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2709" class="timestamp">00:45:09</a><div class="content"> extended. Yeah, so it's all these resizing but if you look at this other picture I've got here um in theory, so actually I'm going to take from you catch 3009 nice feature of decompilers is the ability to copy and paste code C++ compiler. It should compile without errors. I don't know if I've ever actually had that happen with even it?s output. maybe you have I don't think I've ever actually had some that will just compile immediately unless it was like some simple, you know application, but Yeah, so I could see that maybe for is no I just met but I haven't actually had that works re-cap mentioned zi 2 supports it. My experience has been that that hasn't actually been what happens in practice.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2758" class="timestamp">00:45:58</a><div class="content"> I was just going to say in CTF challenges. I can see it maybe where you're dealing with like a you know, not a complex binary you're talking about anything real world though. There's almost no way that's gonna you know, just straight-up compiled without you doing a bunch of stuff as well. So I mean I can kind of see that argument but at the same time, I don't know how many people are actually doing that.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2781" class="timestamp">00:46:21</a><div class="content"> Yeah, like I I definitely like I've tried it just for fun T realize the expected that definitely didn't work that way if maybe Ida has improved since I last tried because essentially what it was was I tried it. It didn't work. I never really cared to try it again. So, I mean what the binary ninja is definitely done here is they have knock on for a see style thing. They've mentioned the possibility of doing that before but they very explicitly they're not going for see. With you know, obviously these so coming back to these extensions of these extensions are happening in the assembly. Like it is actually there and assembly you'll see the move actually making those different sizing extensions, but it does make it very hard to</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2838" class="timestamp">00:47:18</a><div class="content"> read.

They're like, yeah, we do plan to optimize some of that. I had to do some so that's something replying to work on. That is something important here. This is the beta of it's still this did just drop on the development update streams. It's not the final release of it. I imagine regardless they're going to keep working on this. That's why I said I wasn't super impressed, but I wasn't disappointed. This is a very promising start.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2881" class="timestamp">00:48:01</a><div class="content"> So one positive I will mention I haven't checked it out and I'm going to check this out on the stream, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, but one thing I have heard that this decompiler is better than both X-rays and Deidre in is handling some of the extended instruction set stuff like SSE. I've heard it it generally it optimizes that a lot better than x-rays does</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2904" class="timestamp">00:48:24</a><div class="content"> actually it's not tonight though. I'm not too much extended but did find that it basically doesn't support floats. My day taking screenshots, but it's like I forget what the instruction was here that it was failing on but it was just like a move with XMS with the xmm registers.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2923" class="timestamp">00:48:43</a><div class="content"> Okay. So I think that is one thing I've seen those well is that it does need to meet each other a little bit. It is missing some instruction register Ops, I think comparing exchange is another one that doesn't really seem to be supported. So but like</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2938" class="timestamp">00:48:58</a><div class="content"> what it's about some of the water</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2941" class="timestamp">00:49:01</a><div class="content"> But yeah, obviously this decompiler literally just dropped x-rays has been around forever. It's been around for years Deidre has also been in development since like the 90s. So, you know, this is for considering this is a fairly new decompiler. It's obviously not going to be Flawless. It's not going to be without issues but it's going to get that maturity over time and as we've seen with with Benjo with other features, they don't just drop something and then stop working on it. I imagine this decompiler is going to be worked on for years. It's going to be an ongoing thing and as it matures, you know, it's going to get better and as an initial initial starting point, I think this is great. And you know, it's an option out there for people that don't want to use Ghidorah, but also don't want to pay like 10 thousand dollars for all the Ida licenses. But I mean,</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=2989" class="timestamp">00:49:49</a><div class="content"> yeah, no animal.

Yeah. That's it. Here's I am going to pull out a few. Rights, here are a few other issues that we've noticed. So I pulled up the graph you now. This is what you'll see if you use cloud and this is I was mentioning earlier about how the cloud isn't quite the same. So this is that same Bad characters or what was the function call. I think it was like check Bad characters or something is the function name from The Bad characters Rob Emporium challenge if you were paying attention on the video before or if you can't see anything what we see right here with a graph as we see a while loop and we see the VAR being incremented at the base. We see those think what would you see the two increments actually because it's a double for Loop but it treats them in the graph view as wild Loops. Whereas in the linear view, which you do not get in in the free version right now and Cloud. It gives you the four Loops. It gives you something that in my opinion is much more readable than what you see in the graph View. That's interesting. So it basically it seems like a prefers to decompile as a while loop when you're seeing the graph which kind of makes sense because those like parts of the for happening different areas. So make sense to show how things jump around in that whereas the linear view makes a little bit more sense to just show it as is like I kind of get where that came from, but it is worth noting because I did see some complaints about not picking up for loops and I think that's Why I think it's because for those basically only show up when you're in the</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3092" class="timestamp">00:51:32</a><div class="content"> linear View.

I will be doing a stream looking at Benja because I haven't personally since I don't have a commercial license, I'm not balling out that hard but um, you know, I'm going to be looking at the decompiler and comparing it to geed ra seeing like where it's better and trying to check out some of the complaints that I've seen see how much like Merit they have and whether there's a way around it and stuff like that. So I am going to be Doing a string that's going to be exploring that tomorrow. So I do just want to shout that out just in case I forget to show to their to the begin at the end of the episode as well. So, you know just for anybody that's interesting that I will be doing a stream about that and we will probably be doing a more polished video that looks at it, you know without all the you know things that come in the string. We're going to be doing a video on that too. So be on the lookout for that. Yeah. Something</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3146" class="timestamp">00:52:26</a><div class="content"> said.

Are really big issue and that is brutal. Okay. Well, so this is like I'm going to say this is probably personally I see this is something that's going to get fixed very quickly. But if you take a look this check Bad characters function notice the start if at the bar 28 equals 0 x 62, yeah and the for Loop just kind of uses the relative act like it but it's basically looping through the indexes for each character in 4H back. Character if you look at the ml IL though for this function, we noticed something really important, which is that the ml IL has a bunch of assignments earlier on it has the far 20 a far 2726 it assigns the entire array because this is obviously a array being declared on the stack. So it's doing that initialization there as you call in the function at setting up the entire stack with all of the bad characters. Oh decompiler completely optimizes that now Is it is there in the ml I also like it knows it's there. So this seems like something that because the actual Loops only access these indirectly. It doesn't really associate them together. So it's a failure on their part. It seems like a failure that's more like an optimization thing where it's like, oh, hey these variables are he is let's just not show them. It seems like an overzealous optimization that can be tamed back a little bit rather than a really significant. Issue with the decompiler, but it is there right now like that is a huge issue. It just seems to me like it's something that can and will be fixed pretty quickly. But yeah, I just want to point that one. I would also because like that it that's that's a pretty serious issue to be missing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3259" class="timestamp">00:54:19</a><div class="content"> that but that is a good example though of why you should never completely trustee compiler output alway and especially with ginger because you have access to those other intermediate levels.

And I guess to end on a positive note one of my favorite things. It's super small, but I just I just love kind of the fact that it's there and this happens in ml il-2 is they will preface the comparison. So like less than equal to greater than or whatever with a you were in s letting you know, if it's a signed or unsigned</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3319" class="timestamp">00:55:19</a><div class="content"> comparison that is really nice.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3321" class="timestamp">00:55:21</a><div class="content"> And I mean, that's something you kind of lose when you go to see it's just not there unless you know the types and you know how they're going to get upgraded down gray, whatever to know how that's going to get compared.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3331" class="timestamp">00:55:31</a><div class="content"> I said the reason that's really useful is like there are absolutely sinus issues that can lead to some pretty serious bugs and overflows.

That's there. It's just right there. It's information that matters to you that is a really included in like C code that they get to do because they're it's technically not see what they're doing here. So like that, that is one feature that I do really. Really like and here it's super small, but it's just it's such a quality-of-life thing that just they kind of understand how people are using their</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3366" class="timestamp">00:56:06</a><div class="content"> product. So overall, even though we have highlighted a few of the gripes overall. It's definitely a positive. I think it's you know, it's going to get better over time. It's a it's a good starting point. I think overall, you know, it's been well-received. I'll say that yeah, it was a cool idea that they dropped it with the CTF as well though. I do wonder how many serious teams would want to switch up their tools like at the last minute, you know an hour before the CTF, but, you know, they're probably worth some and they probably got some useful. For feedback out of that as well. So, you know, I think I thought that was a pretty cool move. But zi you had some stuff to say on played CTF</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3404" class="timestamp">00:56:44</a><div class="content"> specifically. Yeah - you're moving away from Benja before we move on to that. I will mention of chat again cat 3000.

So now that's been hell. Yeah. I want just call a plot to have I mean obviously plaid parliament of pwning PPP good team always usually really good challenges. I wasn't really planning to play the CTF this weekend, but I have to go and look and just kind of pulled it up early on and shortly after it started and I saw a web challenge for 500 points and the only other 500-point challenges were to potable so that immediately caught my eye. I don't like 16 hours possibly more of good hard work into that challenge and could not could not solve it. So I I just want to I call it out its catalog. I don't know if they release their challenges if they do that. That would be a fun one to go back to the solutions. Actually pretty cool. Like I did kind of figure out by the end. How to get the solution I just didn't get it working but it took advantage of like a new Chrome 80 feature using deep-linking using that kind of exfiltrate information. Sorry for some spoilers. I don't want to go into too much detail with the spoiler. So I just want to thank all those it was an interesting Challenge and while I didn't look at anything else. Odds are a lot of their challenges were good. If they do reeling some check it out</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3542" class="timestamp">00:59:02</a><div class="content"> the did you see any like, I know you nobody saw exactly how large was going to say.

The only reason I say that is as time has been going on. You know, I haven't been following CTS too closely for a while. But the ones that I have tried and you know, seeing opinions of people who have been playing CTS, it's been generally found that CTS are becoming more and more gimmicky by the year, you know, they've kind of yeah of tricks and they're trying to use these obscure things that almost nobody would know and they just have to like Google some rent like get lucky Bay. Clay with a Google search term.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3599" class="timestamp">00:59:59</a><div class="content"> Yeah, so I mean that's kind of the things</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3602" class="timestamp">01:00:02</a><div class="content"> that's going that direction too.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3604" class="timestamp">01:00:04</a><div class="content"> Yeah, so, I mean that's definitely the thing. I've saw planks ETFs a lot. Now for that reason also is like years ago and I actually even said this on want the podcast that I recommended playing a CTF, but the more I've really thought about it the more I realized that no like currants ETFs aren't that good now War Games the kind of long-running C caps are still great for learning from but these the competitive CTF says he said They've become a lot more gimmicky. That's Ed with this one. Like said I spend like 16 hours and I never felt frustrated with the challenge. I never felt like the challenge was unfair and that's that was actually really impressive because usually if there's a web challenge and like I'm banging my head for that long odds are it's some sort of guess work or something, but I was always finding little things that I can maybe abuse. It was just coming up with how to work everything together. I mean he had to chain a bunch of issues can't get this one to work, but they included enough information to kind of lead you towards understanding what he needed. Like I mentioned use that Chrome 80 deep-linking thing, but they explicitly mentioned like it's being viewed from chrome 80 with you block whatever version so you go and you look like okay, what's in Chrome</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3677" class="timestamp">01:01:17</a><div class="content"> 80, you</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3678" class="timestamp">01:01:18</a><div class="content"> know, why aren't they using Chrome 81 or whatever the latest version</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3681" class="timestamp">01:01:21</a><div class="content"> is.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3684" class="timestamp">01:01:24</a><div class="content"> So like they had enough there in terms of the hints to drive you towards the solutions.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3689" class="timestamp">01:01:29</a><div class="content"> Okay, cool.

It's on Chrome whatever so, you know things Chrome fixed. I don't matter like, you know be aware that Crohn's a little bit different than Firefox. Like I could get why somebody wouldn't get that step but they did include that information and and I've kind of learned with a loss ETFs. You've got to read the descriptions. Well, in this case the description actually they explicitly said there's no hint in these big long winded description, but everything else here is what he need to worry about and it was in that other section that included the Chrome 80 that included other things</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3742" class="timestamp">01:02:22</a><div class="content"> So we can move on to Riot games. So obviously, you know, if you follow the gaming world at all Valerie, it's been kind of blowing up and one of the reasons has been blowing up is it's almost like a Counter-Strike clone, but IT addresses a lot of the complaints that come from Counter-Strike players and one of those is cheating. So, you know, they're trying out a new AC called Vanguard for Valor and and the ACs had some controversy over the last little while some stupid controversy. I'll say so in my opinion because it's a kernel driver and it's loaded at boot. It's not loaded when the game is launched and they do that to try to you know, that way they captured the state, you know, they load it basically before any cheat would be running.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3785" class="timestamp">01:03:05</a><div class="content"> Yeah, and that's like that's what you think going zi. Well, I don't think we want to dig too deep into it. I will mention like, you know, they load early on because the earlier you load earlier you're able to like the harder it is for cheats to get in there. Whoever With the first it's going to be able to control kind of what what gets reported.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=3805" class="timestamp">01:03:25</a><div class="content"> Basically.

Yeah, so we have a bit of a last-minute addition as well but a little while ago can we were exactly which episode we talked about Google vrp their vulnerability research program and so they've actually they've got a grant Outfit due to the covid-19 stuff going around so it seems anybody who submitted at least two remunerated reports from 2018 through to April 2020 will be eligible for for a 1337 dollar research Grant. So, you know, if you submitted two reports or I'm guessing towards till the end of the month you can still submit reports. So because it does say April doesn't say April 20th or anything like that.

Like I'm again, I'm not complaining about them offering this obviously, they're going to be people that can't accept the money if they did the research While on work time the it'll be up to their company as whether or not they can accept that.

You can't like so I was saying because of so, one of the issues here is they use the access control allow origin header. They just repeat whatever origin the request came from. It sends back the X control allow origin with that origin. So I would say I was saying you might be text like that aspect a little bit. Basically, this is just a pi dump like the public data. It's not it's nothing too</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4218" class="timestamp">01:10:18</a><div class="content"> special. Yeah, but basically what you can do there is you can force the server to Cache the those arbitrary origin headers which then get echoed to other requests and you can basically use this to force cross-origin request to be denied.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4233" class="timestamp">01:10:33</a><div class="content"> Yeah, so I'll mention we've talked about that with like cash and Confused a while back like some of those different cache attacks where depending on what keys things are being cashed on. So the origin hitter in particular isn't getting cashed our story isn't isn't one of the keys yeah isn't want the keys for the cash so having a separate origin still ends up work are still ends up cashing that request so if you get your request from malicious domain when the actual domain tries to hit it it gets the cash response it has this other origin</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4267" class="timestamp">01:11:07</a><div class="content"> yeah so I mean from a high level view it's a fairly straightforward issue the fix was also fairly straightforward and it's like you said you just you fix the way the cash is based on the origin and it's now keyed based on the origin that way poison requests aren't echoed to other Origins but you know like like you said cache cache poisoning attacks are kind of like those cool ones that you don't see overly often we're definitely seeing more from recent we're seeing more than recently kind of like the desync attacks the HTTP yeah he's a good tax so you know it's fun to cover those but this one you know fairly straightforward earned a five hundred $50 Bounty</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4304" class="timestamp">01:11:44</a><div class="content"> Hunter Bounty to sure what it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4306" class="timestamp">01:11:46</a><div class="content"> is Yeah, it was part of the year ago, but it just saw disclosed last week. So we'll move on to press the shop. So there was a critical see surf to rce bug in prestashop and prestashop. I've never really heard of it before but apparently it's an e-commerce service that allows people to host their own shops and stuff like that. And obviously when you're hosting a shop you're going to need to support images and whatnot. So they provide a file manager that allows various media file types to be uploaded and one of the file types. They allowed to be uploaded is SVG files, which allow JavaScript so using that you can basically get an xss. Now. Obviously this can only really be performed by someone who can upload those SVG files and most likely someone's not going to want to access their own store. But it also seems for whatever reason the file upload request didn't have a csrf token on it. So these are</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4360" class="timestamp">01:12:40</a><div class="content"> just words wherever the action that whatever reason there. It's not uncommon because Sometimes the code that handles just kind of post in general won't be the code that handles multi-part uploads and that's kind of what's important here is that when you do this sort of post request with a file, it's usually it's being done with like URL. I forget what the Mind type is now, but it's just using like that URL encoded like chi chi equals value kind of setup. Whereas with multi-part it's definitely more complicated setup. He giveth the The boundary and then that's kind of used to separate so you can send more binary data. You can send larger packs about that. So when you do a file upload, it's switching protocols a bit. Well not protocols by switching how the content gets parsed and so in a lot of systems it'll be different code that handles that or just the normal postcode won't in the paddling. That's a won't end up checking to see sir. It doesn't seem like that's the case here, but it's not an uncommon thing or upload to be missing or not actually validating. zi serf</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4432" class="timestamp">01:13:52</a><div class="content"> tokens Yeah, so then using that xss, you can basically make a malicious link that they can click on and they escalated it further to get rce because they made it so the excess can fetch the the valid Caesar of token to upload malicious themes through the admin panel and through these themes, you know, it's a zip file. Basically, they contains all the files for it and they allow PHP files in the zip file and they don't check or like me. Negate this at all. They just allow straight-up PHP files to be included in the theme so you literally you just upload a backdoor PHP file that can execute commands and you have command execution on on the server. So it's pretty funny. I'm surprised that they you know, they have see serve tokens for most requests, but they don't like bother the one that matters.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4485" class="timestamp">01:14:45</a><div class="content"> Yeah.

I don't know I'd say it's something to really consider before you allow that. But I mean it is behind. The admin panel it is this is one of those cases. I would just kind of being softer once you're on the inside. You know, it's easier to act like once your admin you're in a trusted position obviously ideal cases just don't have that but it's definitely not uncommon to allow it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4557" class="timestamp">01:15:57</a><div class="content"> This post is pretty cool. It's one of those multi stage attacks. I did find some things a bit weird about it though for one the post mentions that the bug is unpatched as of April 18th, which is when this post was published and there's no disclosure timeline or information or anything like that. So the I just dropped a zero down on the surface because I don't play anything about like responsible disclosure anything and the reason this kind of warning is something like on something like a service and you can get like userland code execution on the server that's quite impactful compared to you know, even if you drop a zero day for something that someone has to like it's a local thing. They're running. It's a lot harder to hit that person where it's a centralized server like this. It's like so much easier to abuse by swirling Eddie's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4603" class="timestamp">01:16:43</a><div class="content"> and I Don't know if this is necessarily centralized server you can this is open source, so you can run this wherever.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4612" class="timestamp">01:16:52</a><div class="content"> But anybody can I don't lot easier to hit than just someone's desktop.

I didn't think you could do that cross-domain. My understanding was that that would be blocked by same origin policy because it's acting on different domain and You can create like a form that would submit to another website. I didn't think you could do the xhr and modify that that's that I did give it a quick test and it did fire off you can read the response but it did fire off. So yeah, I was just a little bit taken aback with it. I'm not sure if that's a kind of recent change, but I'm sure that hasn't always been the case. I do maybe want to dig into that a little bit more because that opens up a ton. Of potential see serfs if you're able to do that. like I said I ran it it did work and you couldn't do the response but it did fire the request without doing any sort of pre-flight so maybe content types now okay to edit maybe it has been that's that it just it did take me back a little bit when I saw that because it seemed it seemed like that wasn't always</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4723" class="timestamp">01:18:43</a><div class="content"> possible the oak is of thing oh sorry going</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4728" class="timestamp">01:18:48</a><div class="content"> well just going to say because what I remember doing is trying to exploit Jason ones where you'd have to kind of mess with to create what look like a Jason body because you can't actually send the content type Jason you'd kind of you'd mess with the key value to be the start of your Json and then just kind of end it off with the equals being or yeah the equals then possibly like and characters and stuff would be just kind of Ended on within the Jason kind of like you just try and capture those extra things that get added to the normal sort of submission. So if you could just send like content like Jason or well application slash Jason and that just opens up a lot easier route still excellent and some of those issues. So I do kind of want to dig into that a little bit more. So I'm just adding that as a bit of a caveat here. It seems like, you know, this definitely worked. I gave it a try but for some Reason, I don't feel right about that. I feel like I'm missing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=4788" class="timestamp">01:19:48</a><div class="content"> something. The only thing I was going to add on was jumping back to the disclosure stuff looking at the advisory. If you look at it, it was posted the day before this right up one up. So prestashop was given if the if it was sent to them they were given one day before this write-up went up. So, you know overall it's an interesting posts and it's a cool multistage attack, but I do question the kind of Ethics, I guess of the post it seems that's fair drop the zero.

So if you're not familiar with JWT that Jason web token the basic idea is that it's a token you can issue to a user and they could just kind of Supply that with their requests and you can validate the token without actually to query the database like the token itself will be signed by your Authority. So, you know, like you were the one that signed it you validate that's a valid token and it'll include things like grants information for like what they're actually allowed to do or you can include a variety of things but the basic idea Is that it's just as a really lightweight way to do with Education Without need to query dead based on every page request. There are some downsides with that. I'm not a big fan of there are a lot of ways. You can shoot yourself in the foot using tokens. So while it definitely has some uses you've got to be careful. It's a lot like crypto in general. You've got to be careful with it because you never want to issue a token. That doesn't expire for example Back in 2015 a big issue was you could also just kind of create create a token and insert the algorithm saying well, what's the signing algorithm? Oh, I didn't sign it at algorithm none and give it all the grants you want and if something just check if it was a ballad token and that it had the right grant and didn't actually validate that it was signed by who they expected to be signed who they expected to be signed by. using the non algorithm is you can basically create your own tokens so in this case off the zero they obviously as most places have they've disallowed using the none algorithm I don't get why not algorithm was even included in the first place maybe development purposes stupid thing to use like you're never going to want to use that in practice like I can't I cannot think of any legitimate reason to use none anyway they banned not and by checking off the algorithms not but they checked it in a case sensitive way so you can set it to done with the capital e and allow you to use the none algorithm again. This might actually even be a competitor for the stupid bug of the week.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5221" class="timestamp">01:27:01</a><div class="content"> Actually.

So this one's kind of a fun one, especially because it isn't get which Muse, you know people use it every day specifically the issue is in the get credential helpers. So, you know, this basically allows you to store credentials so you don't have to enter them every single time. So if you clone a repo and it's a private repo and you enter the password for it, and then you want to push updates to it, you know, you'll probably want to store those credentials so that every time you push you don't have to, you know, enter your crib your creds or whatever so, you know, they give an example if you execute command like get clone example.com Get will call the registered helpers to see if you contain any credits for that domain and then it'll attach those credentials to the outgoing or requests when it's asked for authentication. The problem is in their protocol. The implementation is actually vulnerable to a new line injection. So you can do something like example.com back / or / backslash n host equals github.com. And then the credential helper will think it needs to fetch creds for github.com, but it'll send them to</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5299" class="timestamp">01:28:19</a><div class="content"> example.com. Yeah, so I will just Correct is slightly there? It's a question mark and then the new line you're injecting the new line after the domain and as part of the query or as probably query string just you want to point that out. Otherwise, it's exactly as you said you're just able to inject in the whole protocol there that uses to communicate with the credential helper is just that new line key equals value type setup. So host equal something if you send in a second host a specter said you could get it's sending the wrong creds to the Ang host</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5333" class="timestamp">01:28:53</a><div class="content"> Yeah, now part of the reason I said this was a fun issue and not a serious one is in practice, you know, the attacker would have to send you that link and you would have to use it that link would like a link would let like that would look extremely suspect and I think I'd question anybody who fell for that considering gets user base. Most people who are using get should be wise to not use suspicious-looking links like that.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5360" class="timestamp">01:29:20</a><div class="content"> Let's just clone this repo.

Okay, so actually I guess you're not going to go into it. So they do actually showcase where you have a much more harmless-looking URL, which is git clone and just have like example.com / my are example.com whatever the repo name is duck yet and you can abuse that by using a 301 redirect though you have to basically you can if you redirect that docket requests whatever comes in there to one of these exploitable URLs you can do that but you do have to include a username with it which means it's very lip it has to be targeted in terms of who you're targeting with it But they do include the case that you can use a 301 redirect to basically get the normal-looking Clone request to expose</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5434" class="timestamp">01:30:34</a><div class="content"> something.

Yeah, and the reason why you need the username is basically you would do the injection as part of the credentials part of the URL. So, you know when you do like the HTTP slash slash user name colon password, which most people would never use that type of oh sorry that type of URL I'm practiced but uh it is use that time so username act whatever the website that's why you need to include the username there you injected into the username which then limits who you can attacks need to know their username but yeah that's a practical attack I think it's limited it's targeted but definitely</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5483" class="timestamp">01:31:23</a><div class="content"> doable yeah so NCC group is a you know their articles we've covered quite a few times in the past and this one talks about a local privilege escalation found in the component object model or calm sir this isn't windows so they actually found multiple vulnerabilities but they found one in particular that they wanted to cover because for one it was similar to some of the other issues they found and this one in particular I think Microsoft tried to patch and they failed and then they ended up exploiting it again and Microsoft had to patch it again and the other thing that makes it interesting too is the bug was actually created due to documentation being written incorrectly so that's that's a pretty serious issue because that means that there's initially more areas that have a very similar bug do to reading the documentation and expecting it to function like the doc said even though it doesn't so you know they say like you know even though this issue is fixed there could potentially be more issues like it out there just because it's pain from you know and then correct documentation basically so they looked at various Services running is NT Authority or system and they looked at servers that were executing executing In the windows module installer service context as I think all the server's running in that context are running is NT system. And the one they ended up looking at was the component-based servicing session. So part of what made this cool is they show a way that they first exploited it and then they show are they exploited again after Microsoft failed to patching it. So the bug was a arbitrary file disclosure in the icds session 10 interface. They found a bunch of you know, various methods that are attached to that. Interface but to kind of stood out and that was the initialized and create package methods. So the initialize function needs to be called before any other methods can be called, you know, you can kind of speculate that that's going to be the case just based on it being called initialize and you can pass it a boot drive and a Windows directory as well as some other stuff. There are some restrictions the windows directory has to have the directory structure of a typical Windows installation. So it needs a user's folder and needs to contain certain components. I'm guessing I thought they mean like dlls and other folders stuff like that but an attacker with access can can fake that structure and the other thing they can do is they can also create symbolic links which is then copied and is readable by the attacker which can lead to arbitrary file disclosure now Microsoft Patch this last year in November and what they basically try to do is you know look and say okay this is a symbolic link okay we'll just reject this we're not respecting the symbolic link so when they looked at it again after the Patch they noticed an error was being logged but the service was still copying the target file and this was because the boy they checked if the file was a symbolic link they use the get file attributes W method and the win API to check if the attribute is set for the symbolic link and this would work fine if the function worked out the documentation set it worked and the documentation said if the path points to a symbolic link make the function returns attributes for the symbolic link knocked the target file and that turns out to be wrong the it Returns the attributes of the final Target file not the actual symbolic link so because of that there check was essentially useless and it would still end up copying that Target file so this was again finally patched last month so it's just one of those cool things where you can see like just because an issue is patched doesn't mean it was patched correctly so that's one thing and then the other thing is you know you have to kind of question the documentation sometimes yeah liked a</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5716" class="timestamp">01:35:16</a><div class="content"> question question the documentation I just thought it was interesting that the two tools that create symlink to on the make link tool had different behaviors there too because that was kind of what the difference there was when a symbolic links crave with the make link tool get file attributes does return the appropriate attributes and includes that file actually reparse point that they're looking for but when you use the create symlink tool the documentation was wrong the documentation indicate that what do that and it doesn't I just I just found that interesting that the two different tools ended up resulting in some different and I'm sure like, it creates a slightly different type of Link because Windows has a bunch of different link types.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=5762" class="timestamp">01:36:02</a><div class="content"> I was going to say I'm not really a Windows person but I think part of the issue is that there's different types of those thinking Microsoft terminology.

I'm actually getting to that point was a little bit more complicated. Just trying to attend here with bad credentials of course of what end wouldn't work that probably would have been discovered pretty quickly. But there was kind of an issue where it would say one of the internal Flags a lot earlier than it should even if the authentication request wasn't successful. It would have still set this flag saying that he weren't Anonymous earlier on on which ultimately you would basically do that add yourself to add yourself to the admin User Group once you're kind of addenda cated at that level and then you can access</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6021" class="timestamp">01:40:21</a><div class="content"> vsphere yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6025" class="timestamp">01:40:25</a><div class="content"> so so I was just going to say so this is like the opposite of information disclosure nothing's being disclosed yeah until you add yourself as an admin or whatever</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6036" class="timestamp">01:40:36</a><div class="content"> yeah but like you were saying it's an off bypass one thing that was kind of interesting though was that first issue you're talking about one thing I'll say about that by the way just as a quick like interject as a it reminds me a lot of the Nintendo switch bug I don't know if you remember like the switch presentation that was done at CCC a little while back but they had a bug where they set the initial pit I think for your access like they did an access check for you know The process was allowed to access certain kernel driver stuff or something like that and they checked if the pit was 0 for Colonel because that has root privileges. So they ended up specifying a default of pit equals zero, but then on a fail condition, they never actually set PIN to the correct one. So it's kind of like an uninitialized use it's initialized to zero, but they don't initialize it to the actual pit. Yeah, that's kind of what's Happening Here. They don't initialize the error from zero.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6091" class="timestamp">01:41:31</a><div class="content"> That's where it's safe.

I think if this this example here does not actually go through exploiting it. lately it just shows basically that there is a bug in the Heap and they talk a little all right there is a buffer overflow he based it in basically just meant it comes out of the PSN file structure ends up being populated out of prepared PS info I mean where else would you expect it to get the information from but what it ends up doing at some point later on is if I can find the code example is it'll do a concatenation in one of the strings where it basically just adds a bracket whatever your argument was and bracket that's if when it's filling in our arguments it basically just adds that in there if your argument actually start with like a - space or something so if you do that it depends that little bit string it doesn't account for that offense so if you have a large if you have a Mac sighs string again to that point you like your buffers already full you can overflow by maximum in this case like I think that'll fill up 15 bytes you can provide and there's that argument plus the two brackets no bite leading to they mentioned specifically 17 bites of overflow 17 bites is not large enough to reach other structures that actually kind of matter in there so you can't get the control you can't get Direct Control flow sorry you can get direct access to the control flow with this you can to overwrite anything that's like a critical control structure you can corrupt the P child and P sibling I think it is which you may then be able to leverage into an exploit they did not actually do that yeah but and so they do also Mexican some extra challenges they're like said like that that's the gist of the ex white it appends the string and it doesn't actually count for that in terms of the string size so it can overwrite easy enough to understand exporting this might be difficult it does mention it does starve with privilege bracketing it does you have the proc owner set on it it does drop that pretty quickly though so you have a very limited time to abuse that and your buffer is going to end with that bracket and know which may or may not actually impact what you can do Force you have to deal with ASL are still a lot of work to still be done but it's kind of you know it's an issue in a pretty significant binary</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6532" class="timestamp">01:48:52</a><div class="content"> I could see this potentially not being exploitable just because you have so many compounding issues on top of it</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6538" class="timestamp">01:48:58</a><div class="content"> I'm at the very least you're probably I need another Gadget.

So that makes exploitation so much cleaner and nicer and they basically found another member in the structure that they could corrupt to easily get an arbitrary, right? And because you know that memory is so deterministic. They can also you know, they don't have to worry about ASL are they can defeat a SLR and then they just use that to smash the credential structure of the process to get uid 0 so You know, the exploitation of it is fairly straightforward the actual bugs. It's kind of fun because it sucks about you know, that discrepancy between 32-bit and 64-bit and all the math that goes into that. I do think they could have covered it a little bit better getting those details that I just said took a lot of like mental effort to try to understand what they were trying to say. I think a diagram or something would have been really helpful here, but overall the issue is really cool and hitting You think it kernel level especially when it's that complex and that subtle I guess is always fun to read about so we wanted to cover it.</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=6986" class="timestamp">01:56:26</a><div class="content"> So yeah, I mean, I'd agree with you on the right up being a little bit little bit hard to follow and that I think is it's a guess right up also.

They basically have this, you know function that allows you to have a shared buffer between the kernel and Trust Zone which for people who don't know trust Zone. It's a trusted execution environment in the chain of trust. It is higher than Colonel. Technically. If you have Colonel access, you should not be able to mess with anything and trustzone. So it needs that kind of mechanism to be able to bridge to communicate with trust Zone and</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7190" class="timestamp">01:59:50</a><div class="content"> Yeah, I do want to jump in before you go too deep with this and just mention there's this principle in programming do not repeat yourself or dry. I guess it's don't repeat yourself not do not but I'll the dry principle don't repeat yourself. And I think that kind of had came into play with this issue a little bit part of this issue comes down to they're two different cases as Spectre was mentioning about this buffer that's used to communicate with trustzone. Basically your station will allocate this buffer ion buffer that you can use to communicate and there's the function here that's vulnerable is the qse cam update command buffer or the 64-bit version of it and that will basically go and it will translate pointers is effectively the idea turn the pointers take the buffer turn the pointers into something trustzone will understand and it handles two different cases in which the buffers need to be modified and two different eye off dolls end up reaching it in am calling it for two different handlings and that's where I think dry kind of came in here they tried to centralize what was more of an incidental repetition rather than actual repetition that needed to be prevented because winds where you can know this happens is when you start seeing a path where you know at first you have exactly the same code pretty much so hey I'm going to create a function that just you know takes argument and then you'll need to update this function whenever you want to change it and then when you see a flag being added you see something else being ad that will change that methodology that will change how it works that's when you know that you probably shouldn't have actually repeated that function when you start adding those flags that make significant changes it should be a secondary function rather than being just you know combining it so I just wanted to point that out with I feel like that dry idea like you do have to be aware of the idea of incidental repetition where the repetition is there but it's only incidental to what's going on and it's not actually something you should combine into one</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7316" class="timestamp">02:01:56</a><div class="content"> function Yeah, one of those things that contributes to this issue is this code would be fine in userland because basically what you were saying with the two different types, they track it through this you'll see it on if anybody watching you'll see it on the screen they say data type. So they have this data structure that stores the type. The problem is that that data structure is attached to the file descriptor is attached to the device. So, you know, if you have two different octaves that can change the type from underneath the other thread that's Where the race condition comes into play now if this code was sitting in userland this code would probably be fine. The issue comes in where in Colonel it's very easy to have concurrent access and that's where a lot of Kernel driver issues bond from the fact that it's people who aren't familiar with the pitfalls that come with working in Colonel. They can be fair sitter that there's going to be concurrent access. There</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7371" class="timestamp">02:02:51</a><div class="content"> is mitigation. Actually they do they do have some level of mitigation. I believe against the concurrent access it just wasn't evident here just not good enough yeah as you are saying though just one route and I will save this where two different functions though you wouldn't be able to like the changing of the data type what a matter that's where I was getting at it from was you know by not rip the whole dry principle and up kind of backfiring here because they have the one function doing two things I guess that always comes down to separation of concerns but if this were two functions even if that change therefore the function shouldn't have been even looking for that data type later on it's kind of what I was getting</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7411" class="timestamp">02:03:31</a><div class="content"> at Yeah, so depending on what you hit they say this can be used to hit naldi references or buffer overflows.

I do just want to kind of clarify the last bug at Specter kind of mention if you can change at the data type. So as I was saying here where this function will change or it will check the data data type to decide what to do. So you can have a function that will start with one data type called cause the other eye off to be called changes that data type and it'll end doing the other functionality. I just want to kind of clarify that point just make it explicit what the bug was you can go onto the uaf</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7470" class="timestamp">02:04:30</a><div class="content"> okay yeah that's fair so in another function which is also called from the same I octal Handler is QC comset client member am and this can be used to set the request length now obviously this is bounced check that's not a super obvious you know issue like that it's not a low-hanging fruit issue so if it's too large it will bail within Val which is a common error code for stuff like that the problem is it resets the handle but because the the check fails no other parameters are modified and they're not wiped out so it will end up pointing to a previously set ion buffer which is already been freed so it's a classic use after free after a lot of digging I was able to find the patch it probably took me like 20 minutes just to find the patch but I will bring it up just because it does kind of clarify what the issue is if you're not familiar with the code base I've just brought it up here basically all they did to fix this issue was on error they basically just memset the entire structure to 0 so as soon as you go to use the next you know the next iteration of that driver I guess is a good way of saying it it won't be able to access that stale data on the fail so you know it's just a it's a it's a classic use after free very straightforward</div></div><div class="line"><div

say that I think they're codebase still isn't resilient to this issue they haven't included the patch so you know you can see on the timeline here the security bulletins was published and sung put in

class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7683" class="timestamp">02:08:03</a><div class="content"> yeah okay good yeah the yeah it's good to point out the episode number I couldn't remember the exact number so you know you need the read primitive to know where to write to because essentially the SMB ghost vulnerability the way they hit it it gave you an out of bounds memory corruption on the Heap through an integer overflow in the decompressed function and you can use that to get an arbitrary kernel right I'm not going to talk about that issue too much just because we already covered that in depth on episodes we talked to it episode 36 but what's important to note there is you can also hit other adjacent data with the memory corruption as well and one thing you can hit for example is like peanut raw buffer or some other member that gets copied to a response because your corruption is in the request packet so to other members contained in the same header are Pointers to mdl structures and mdl for those who don't know it stands for a memory descriptor list and what's important what's important about those is is they contain physical memory pointers so you know when you're talking about kernel-level you have two different types of memory you have virtual memory and physical memory so virtual memory gets mapped to physical memory and it's a lot easier to work with physical memory is the actual the real address if you want to call it that that contains the the data and what's important about that is physical memory is harder to randomize then virtual memory virtual memory with a slrs like that it's a lot easier to deal with and that actually comes into play here there's a reason they went with that ndl method so they fake these mbl's and they K user shared data because they're they're mapped to fix locations and both user land and Colonel so you don't have to deal with a SLR they're mapped in fixed locations so they talk about some of the walls they hit with while doing this and I won't cover all that hear those who are interested are free to look at the right up but suffice it to say they basically get arbitrary physical memory read through that that mdl method now I'm not experienced some windows but apparently hitting the page tables is a common exploit strategy and windows kernel exploitation which kind of makes sense page tables are are pretty powerful to mess with so because of that Microsoft tries randomizing the address of the PML for or page map level for self reference entry and they do that by randomizing the index the problem is that happens at the virtual memory level that doesn't happen at the physical memory level so while the wall the index is randomized the physical address of that entry is not randomized and that's why I was saying you know physical memory can be really powerful to hit at the kernel level if you can do it so it seems bios always had it at a hex one a a000 and UEFI always had it at x 1 AD 0 0 0 so now they can I can basically get arbitrary read write and what they ended up hitting was the hardware abstraction layer how they essentially searched the physical backing memory of the house Heap to find the interrupt controller and smash one of the function pointers for the interrupt controller there are some other challenges even after code execution specifically they highlighted they tried launching a user mode process but they had some struggles with that because Windows user land uses control flow guard CFG but you know I don't want to go into that too too much just because this is a pretty dense right up and I will say you you will probably need some in-depth Windows knowledge to be able to fully appreciate it to fully understand it that's why you know I don't want to go too much into those issues partially because I don't have a strong background in Windows and I don't think he does either so we can't go too much into exactly how all that works I don't want to say like things that are like over the incorrect or anything like that at overall though I thought it was cool right up it's fun to see how an LP e can be turned remote using clever tricks like abusing physical memory like that I don't know if you have any other thoughts on that see</div></div><div class="line"><div

like that there was some way of getting that that's what it was originally reported as the lp was clearly just because they had the right what can they and this is what we talked about in episode 36

last minute so I can't have much to say in depth on</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=7974"

you know I wanted to read it more in depth so that's that's what happened there I will say though the actual issue that led to the arbitrary right if you're interested in that the post that we covered a few weeks ago does a way better job I think it has like really nice diagrams and it makes it a lot more accessible I don't think this one covered the the bug as well as the other post that being said this one I'm not saying like this one has a lot to offer that method of hitting it remotely it's very interesting and obviously isn't going to be included in the LPE version but just the bug details you might want to check out that other post but overall yeah I think the I think this was a really cool post and it finally demonstrated that it can be hit remotely like Ms were saying</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8028" class="timestamp">02:13:48</a><div class="content"> yeah and actually I

we're going to cover you know in depth we will move on to some of our research stuff so our research stuff this week is focused on fuzzing our first one is called I John which is exploring deep State spaces with fuzzing deep State I don't think they mean like you know the intelligence community's</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

class="timestamp">02:14:31</a><div class="content"> you never know so I John is I think it's basically supposed to be like an annotation mechanism that allows humans to guide father's through problems of block a lot of modern fuzzers yeah so that's its own it's not really a fuzzer but it's something that interfaces</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8086" class="timestamp">02:14:46</a><div class="content"> with well so it's built on AFL so uses AFL kind of modern fuzzing what they kind of noted here is modern fuzzing you know they look the XY kind neighborhoods of test cases you give it a test case it mutates a test case into something else roughly related to it but there are tons of cases that are just the probability of triggering are randomly is just super small very limited if it's not actually kind of looking for that so what they've introduced here is the idea of being able to do some annotation so it's mixing kind of that code coverage guiding with limited value guided coverage for trying to hit all the different values for something and they provide kind of a good example of kind of the Curren there I think it's either in this or it's in their demo release I don't see it here so much been the other thing so what they kind of use as an example there's getting code coverage on some sort of maze application where all the application does is it basically just has a switch on if you had wasd or you know up down left right it one of those characters it adjusts a single value the xry up or down and that's all it really does so by adding an annotation they're just saying like hey also do we value guided coverage on the X and Y values because getting code coverage you could hit those for code paths up down left right super easily you're going to get a complete code coverage there but you also want to get that coverage of those are all the possible X and Y values which is kind of where they come in adding annotations for that and so by adding an annotation thing like hey these values are also important fuzz those they found they were able to get they use Mario's the example they're able to get much deeper into it into in this case the like said they use Mario trying to be the different levels there if you get much deeper in there and actually complete most levels</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8211" class="timestamp">02:16:51</a><div class="content"> yeah so if you want to see some of the implementation stuff of like some of the helper functions they provide if you go to page 8 I think you had it up briefly they had like a listing of some of the functions you have so they have like I John comp I John hash in tashman hashtag all that kind of stuff and what you were saying with like testing on Mario they also had a table on the 10th page I want to say yeah the 10th page and they have like this little table comparing AFL well on its own along with I John in the AFL and all the Mario levels that could solve so like you could see AFL it only hit a hundred percent of the distance on a few of the levels where I jotted hit on all of the levels basic or</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

of a weird yeah but I so doing a ion games isn't that weird though so I don't know I mean it is a little bit of fuzzing like it's definitely a weird Benchmark it's not unheard of though because he do cut you have a goal you have a very particular score like you have some that can prove it's doing that and it's just kind of a test test case of see it's getting deeper into it it's able to get that depth because we tell it to focus on this these particular types of</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8294"

of the paper</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8303" class="timestamp">02:18:23</a><div class="content"> well it's also it's also like the between just code coverage which is just you know the control handle or hit all the buttons and you've got it all the code coverage versus kind of all the different areas also like it's it illustrates the difference between what it's fuzzing</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8319" class="timestamp">02:18:39</a><div class="content"> for yeah so I did want to cover some of the observations they made before they got into their implementation details which we just covered I think it I think there's some useful observations there so one thing they found was code coverage is sometimes overestimated and what it provides just because it'll keep hitting irrelevant State changes and that's why they say like a human who can identify and guide those State changes might be more useful which is why they provide those those helper functions and stuff another thing they found was it might not be obvious to a father what can actually influence the state and and to what degree and the last thing was sometimes you don't even have good State information to work with so one example they give is like magic bites for that AFL doesn't really know how to handle those so all of these things the paper authors are you could be improved by you know including an actual person in that equation so I like the idea I do have some questions though like you were saying earlier while Super Mario is fun I don't think it should really be used as a serious Benchmark I'd want to see how this performs and works on larger complex code bases they you know they kind of they say they tested it against a test hashmap implementation and amaze and Super Mario if they're going to be fuzzing things I want to see how it actually works in the real</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8399"

you can't that's that's purely speculation is if you can instrument them you know find a concave get that code in there and then instrument the calls out from there I met there's the possibility you could do that but yeah I mean right now you do have to compile it in there</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a

a bit of like human intervention right like you have to have the human looking at the state changes knowing when to wear to put in those functions they have to edit and recompile the source code every time they want to make a change this requires a lot of human effort and one of the big Boons of fuzzing is to try to move away from doing that you know you just let the fuzzer run while you do other stuff maybe you co dot it while you have the fuzzer running and you just kind of leave it sit there</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a

more effort on top of that well yeah I was going to say that though you can kind of relate to that I feel like this is more were hybrid fuzzing would come in rather than annotations using like the constraint solving to find those other paths that it's not not being able to hit I feel like I feel like there's maybe something to doing the annotations for what's of Interest maybe in another way like I think there's something to the idea there for sure</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8503"

see I kind of I question it to like I don't think it's going to be the next big thing I feel like that's kind of going towards more hybrid fuzzing</div></div><div class="line"><div

point out in the papers I thought it was kind of a cool quote it said computers are incredibly fast accurate and stupid humans are incredibly slow inaccurate but brilliant so that's why they're kind of marrying the idea of bringing the two together to try to find more</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8543"

to fuzzing like if you take the time to get the right the perfect Corpus for testing with it usually pays off a lot when you actually put the human in there to get some of that worked on versus just automation there's definitely work being done to try and automate a lot of them but the human intelligence aspect of it I think is still important at least right now like it still plays a big part</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8577" class="timestamp">02:22:57</a><div class="content"> I do like I

just be you know a person who that's their only job I feel like that would just be like you do that as part of your initial setup ramping up on a project he do some of that to decide where you want the fuzzer to focus on set up some annotations or whatever and then otherwise it's more or less as normal it's you know part of that initial research phase and just getting up to speed on a new project</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8613" class="timestamp">02:23:33</a><div class="content"> our last topic before shed its is another fuzzing paper it's a Pangolin which is incremental hybrid fuzzing with polyhedral path abstraction It's About Soul yeah so revisiting something we've talked about before hybrid fuzzing so just because it's been a little while since we talked about it hybrid fuzzing is basically the idea of combining live fuzzing with symbolic execution to try to get better State tracking and overall</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8637" class="timestamp">02:23:57</a><div class="content"> coverage so not just that but can kolak execution is kind of important of concrete and symbolic execution I mean you did kind of say that with the live running but they take the live running they take kind of the register values again to functions they take on all that live data and then apply that into some contrary solving and using some symbolic execution on that concrete data that you've already gotten to help determine new seeds to determine new mutations and using that constraint solving to find ways into New</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8670" class="timestamp">02:24:30</a><div class="content"> Paths yeah so they note that existing hybrid father's can often get like super high overhead and lose efficiency we've covered some of the issues with hybrid buzzing before partially you know it can be hard to integrate with certain code bases because of you know the challenges that come with it but the problem that they point out is that the father is not able to keep track of the state when going deep into nested paths so you end up with the state not really being preserved when it could be useful so you get you end up with like these redundant recalculations of the state is how I read it and I think the part of the reason they do that is maybe to prevent State explosion on the like colic execution side of things but I'm not ya know</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8714" class="timestamp">02:25:14</a><div class="content"> that that's pretty much exactly why is State explosions kind of the big issue yeah</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="Specter" class="author">Specter</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8720" class="timestamp">02:25:20</a><div class="content"> so that's where the incremental part comes in the heart of their tool is to try to fix that problem it does get pretty mathy because they talk about their own term which is in the the title polyhedral path abstraction but I think it's basically used to try to help out and guide the smt constraint solving and try to guide the mutation for code coverage but it is you know when you're getting into constraint solving and stuff like that you can see like there's these equations with symbols that most people probably don't even know exist</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8749"

with the logic symbols that said it is great mathematics well I don't think he did a CS the curry either no I didn't I'm basically saying if you have a degree it should be familiar which isn't a good

path abstraction and stuff works but you know for those who are interested in the math behind that it is there the link will be in description but overall it seems to be trying to solve a problem that has been plaguing hybrid fuzzing so it seems to be trying to do something novel so even though we can't cover it too in depth we did at least want to mention it in the podcast yeah it's like at</div></div><div class="line"><div data-author="zi" class="author">zi</div><a href="https://youtu.be/ys1dU_Xd3cE?t=8813" class="timestamp">02:26:53</a><div class="content"> least</div></div><div

gist of it here being that it is trying to kind of solve that keeping some history being able to kind of guide the mutation a bit through that history and guide something constraint solving like I said show myself something issues there it is a take on it unfortunately it was a little bit dense for us to kind of be able to give you guys the full details there but you know it's it's kind of

when we gone I John that actually came that was mentioned by exp why on our Discord he's who first time link that out so I did want to give a shout out there sorry I forgot to do with that paper but when I was doing that I tried to find a good source for the paper figure out like how old it was and things like like that before I decide if we'd cover it or not and I came across this really cool GitHub which is literally just fuzzing paper and all this is a collection of recent fuzzing papers it's getting updated so I just wanted to kind of share that you know if you're interested in the fuzzing of research seems to have a good collection of them paying attention to what's coming out it's also just a good collection of fussing papers I also want to just put a question out to the community and just ask me aware of a similar repository for exploit development either just exploit mitigations or development or both or something along that because if that's not being done I think

possibly a little bit later Eastern Standard time tomorrow so you know tune into that if you're certain that but we'll wrap up the show here thanks to everyone who tuned in you can catch the vods on Twitch right now or YouTube 24 hours after the stream also 24 hours out of the stream we have the previous podcasts up on Spotify Apple podcast Google podcasts all the pretty much anywhere you can get
