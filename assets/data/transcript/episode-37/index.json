Okay, before we have some before we jump into topics, we do want to mention we have been getting transcripts tons. He's been working on that. So you'll find on our Blog the transcripts are up for the last episode and all the episodes going forward are going to have transcripts as well. They're not perfect. They are about\", \"start\": 43.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" their General are far from perfect. I will say that right now like since we since I do have it on screen you can see on here there for anybody. It's from song. Go is what Specter said very early on and when he introduced me it's so I'm Specter with me a zi.\", \"start\": 65.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So, you know, I've gotten your name is kind of weird way. I can't\", \"start\": 82.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" be. Yeah, I saw it did during my test runs actually get zi, correct when I gave it the hints for it, but regardless, I mean it's definitely not good, but there's enough there that you know, you can control laughs for something of interest if you want links links to the video on the side to get what we actually Said about something just trying to be there for those of you who don't really want to listen to All two hours, but maybe want to find a particular topic, you know, it's in there. It's probably not going to get any more accurate anytime soon. This is already using like Google speech to each attack stuff using their premium versions of it. So this is probably as good as it's going to get for a while until somebody actually wants to manually do it.\", \"start\": 86.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Wait, what's what I found kind of funny but the transcripts was for some reason. It seems Google speech seems to think me and anti are the same person. It will kind of put our statements together. Like it'll put stuff that anti says under my name.\", \"start\": 134.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, so at the end of statements actually so kind of happens on this one here this starts off that we as we covered on Facebook research when I was talking about last episode. Well Facebook research that we was Something. I Said Knock You So it does seem to some delay in there unless you just now mentioned like transcripts are there all the episodes going forward will have a link to the link to the transcript at the\", \"start\": 147.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" bottom. Yeah, so with that being said we'll jump into some topics. So we're going to kind of revisit something here a little while ago. We talked about Corp.com. There was a Krebs article on it back in February and how Microsoft was basically kind of being extorted in a way to try to buy it for 1.7\", \"start\": 177.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and all that was episode 28. Yeah anybody who wants to look back and what we call him dead?\", \"start\": 197.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So the reason for that is, you know, internal corporate networks will try to send like Scholes and data Corp.com due to defaults from all the way back in the 90s and the previous guy who the guy who owned it. Myk O'Connor he had it for 26 years and was trying to sell it for 1.7 million dollars and it seemed originally Microsoft wasn't going to buy it. They offered 20K for it like many years ago, but it didn't go through. Well, it seems Microsoft actually has now kind of bit the bullet and bought it. So, you know just kind of a follow-up to that story. We covered a little while ago. I think it's pretty cool.\", \"start\": 203.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I mean I still kind of think it feels very much like extortion at the same time me the fault here is like it is Microsoft's fall for choosing to use Corp.com as their default rather than you know, there are reserved in special use domain names dot invalid should always give you an NX domain return response Dolph Local Host is reserved. No RFC whatever for it should always return the loopback address da test. Like there are options here that could be used. That said maybe it wasn't at the time. I actually don't know when those rfc's came into play. But at least you know future updates. It should have been changed.\", \"start\": 239.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I mean, I think we're kind of an agreement that they shouldn't have had to but at the same time, you know, 1.7 million dollars kind of a drop in the bucket for Microsoft and I think it's it's still a good move by them, you know protect their customers and stuff like that.\", \"start\": 285.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So, yeah, it's a good move for them. But I just can't really stand behind the guy also try to sell it for\", \"start\": 298.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's kind of annoying on that part, but overall, you know, it worked out I think\", \"start\": 305.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, then like I said, it's a drop in the bucket. So I mean like I do think Microsoft should have bought it bought it earlier. Yeah, it's like we talked about this. I mean, it just feels very much like extortion on that, you know saying how he's going to sell it if Microsoft doesn't buy it I can get him trying to get rid of it, but Yeah, I mean we like I said, this was episode 28 we spent spent a fair chunk of time talking about it actually.\", \"start\": 315.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so you can go back and get the full conversation on that if you want a bit more insight into that but move on so usually when we cover the, you know, covid-19 stuff that's going on. It's usually in a negative light with things being canceled and stuff like that. But we're going to bring some positive news around it. And that's that hacker one is starting a little campaign where you can actually donate bug Bounty payouts or a split of them directly to the who covid-19 response fund.\", \"start\": 345.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so I didn't realize but this is actually kind of old news kind of new so I wasn't familiar with this aspect with hacker one. You can set collaborators when you have a bounty said who your collaborator what was and then you can like split the Bounty which is pretty cool. There's a particular user hack for good which was split here Bounty with a Charitable organization or with some charity. So this month it happens to be the who and their covid-19 response fund but that changes every month. So it's not necessarily a new feature. It's just that the hack for good this month is in particular on the who was response fund. Yeah.\", \"start\": 373.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So like you were saying it works through their built-in collaborator system. You just add the user for for that and set the ratio you want to split to donate. And invite them to the report not all bounties support collaboration. But in those cases you can email them to set it up as well. I do have some questions around it though. I'm guessing this is all up to the researchers. And so ultimately they're the ones getting paid. But yes, I do with inviting a collaborator could vendors split researcher payouts forcefully, I wonder Like\", \"start\": 418.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I imagined some things through\", \"start\": 451.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so on so\", \"start\": 453.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I don't think vendors could necessarily do a forcefully if there probably is a means that they could have some agreement with hack Wanda that said, I mean this also feel like when companies do this it always feels a little bit little bit cheap to me. So it's not that this is a bad thing in a sense, but at the same time hacker One is basically just making it easier for you to donate but you donate through them. So they get the tax\", \"start\": 455.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" write-off.\", \"start\": 484.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That's a boy. That's and that's why companies do this like you're able to place the donation through them. It's same thing like supermarkets when they ask you to donate. They're donating that money. They get the tax write-off for you. Just you know, get to donate my conveniently. so, I mean imagine if hacker one were to decide, you know, if this was because this was important enough for them to put out the Blog post about who this months now, and actually I guess to be fair. I don't know if they put out this like every month of blog post with it. I don't recall seeing similar blog posts in the past stacker one is one of the blog's that I follow for this but assuming they don't they found this one to be a particular importance to mention this option to donate. Imagine if they were to just take off the top like a percent of their cock rather than saying like research Had to give out of their cup but hacker one which is going to donate a percent again, that would have a much greater impact. They're just saying like yeah, take your money. You can donate through US.\", \"start\": 486.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, ultimately the money is coming out of the researchers pocket not the vendors order hacker wants pocket. Yeah, they like you're saying they are getting the right off. So maybe maybe not as much of a positive light as I initially thought but that\", \"start\": 554.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" is not I mean it's so things like this. So to be clear like they do add a convenience factor to making the donation. They're definitely going to be people that wouldn't have donated otherwise, so it is getting my same thing with the supermarket system. Just having it so convenient and right there leads to more people donating like it does actually help with that. So it is a good thing. It's just you know, it always feels like a little bit of a scam to me when I see these\", \"start\": 566.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" things. Yeah, my bigger worry was that point I brought up earlier with like I'm what wondering if vendors could forcefully split the payouts. I honestly don't think that wouldn't happen. I think that would be like, I\", \"start\": 593.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" don't think there's any word. I mean, I don't know what their side looks like for that.\", \"start\": 606.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" But yeah, that's what kind of wondering like obviously we don't have insight into that because we don't have a hacker one Downey running. So I don't know what the vendor view of that looks like, but it was just something I was kind of thinking about fair enough if anybody is running like a half. Our one program. Feel free to let us know if you know, I'm off base but that but that was just something I kind of was thinking about\", \"start\": 609.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it. Well, I mean that functionality seems like something that would be more based on the researcher to say who their collaborator is not a vendor to say you collaborated with this person. Even if you didn't\", \"start\": 631.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the only reason like I think along those lines too, but I'm also thinking vendors might not want people just arbitrarily inviting collaborators in so I'm wondering if they might have At least some sort of influence on that but I don't know. It was just something, you know, it's not something I can take concretely one way or the other but it's been a while since we've had some releases and we have one right now and it's the red deck decompiler and it's hit version 4.0. So for those of you that don't know about rep tackett's decompiler based on llvm and it supports like a variety of architectures sports. X86 64 a rmp. Also\", \"start\": 642.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" 64 is one of Of the newer things\", \"start\": 682.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" for is one of the newer things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and also supports like other file formats like Pease elfs Mac OS so it supports like a lot of stuff but with 4.0 like you were just saying it's added even more support. They have support for Eric 64, they added support for Json output and they have a more modular build system. So\", \"start\": 686.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, so it's the build system that I'm kind of most excited about so I've used wrecked actually for quite a while was kind of my go-to. The compiler, you know when I didn't have access to Ida so it was a so early on it was basically a web interface you can upload a file and it'll do the D compilation. They had an API also that actually tied in there's an Ida plug-in you can use so when they open source this I think it was like I want to say a few years back with maybe 2017 2018. They open source that it was an exciting thing because now you know, it would become a lot more useful the reality though was it was an absolute pain to use. So the new build system seems like it should make that easier. They basically Specter already mentioned me a lot more modular. They swapped out or got rid of all the shell scripts for Python scripts. Hopefully will be an improvement. I haven't been able to try it yet, but I'm hoping that will kind of improve the usability of it. And I think the Json output is an interesting they've added, you know instead of just Being able to pull out. The actual D compilation they basically got all the tokens that does put set in Jason form. So if you want to process with something else, you don't need a reprocess the decompiled output. It's already done that for you. And I just kind of removing One Step, but it makes it a lot more usable for the\", \"start\": 706.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" machine. I will say it's really nice because I don't know if you'd want to argue with me on this point, but I'd say Jason is probably the best non-binary cereals serialization format. So I really like when things that have Jason support especially for something as useful as like\", \"start\": 803.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" when decompiler so, I mean, it's more than just the Json support here though. It's fact that's adjacent support of all the tokens that it generated a me. I think that's kind of the key thing. They're having That was tokens already having a tokenized just because otherwise, you know for just outputs found you do expect a decompiler to Output source code. You do expect it to Output that not Jason. So the fact that you don't have to do that step. You just you get more accuracy out of fact, I think that's kind of a net positive for if you want integrate this as just a step in a further further workflow. They've made that a lot easier to\", \"start\": 821.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" do. Yeah, basically they make it they made it so you cut you can still skip the step of parsing like Friday the lexical parser yourself it basically does that part for you, which is that really awesome because doing lexical parsing is like it is quite complex the other part that's pretty cool that they added as they actually have a library for now to they have like an official library for it. So and I think it has like bindings for a lot of the popular languages like, you know rust see golang so it's got a I think it's got a lot of those bindings if I remember right from when I looked at the GitHub for it, I'd say the library is probably the coolest part. I did want to ask a question though because you were saying you've used red deck a lot. I haven't really used it. How does it compare in like how accurate it is compared to like x-rays or sleigh for example,\", \"start\": 864.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so that's I haven't done really a really good comparison there. So I was using it to one of the reasons I was using is because it's poor mips, which I didn't. Or actually I'm not even sure if Ida does well. Yeah, I don't know if I had a dust support mix yet with its decompiler, but there's\", \"start\": 914.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" probably a plug-in for it or something but\", \"start\": 933.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" perhaps like I'm not sure either way so and I have had a chance to play around with deidre's decompiler and MEP stuff. So I can't really say how good or bad it\", \"start\": 935.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" was. Okay,\", \"start\": 944.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" because this was working on some PS2 stuff when I was using\", \"start\": 946.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it. But in your experience using red deck was the it was better than snowball fairly accurate.\", \"start\": 950.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, no bar though. So again, I was working on PS2 stuff there. Like I couldn't expect it to have the library stuff. Like I couldn't expect it to know all that. So I can't even compare on that. It was just it was definitely sufficient for what I was doing and like said better than snowball.\", \"start\": 957.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It could be something fun to look at you know on a stream just trying to compare like the decompiler of put rub threat deck compared to slay and possibly X-rays. I don't know if we could with weed\", \"start\": 976.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" wandering Souls, but I mean, I think there would be so this is kind of actually leading up I think to some of them will get in the next topic but I do think that's something we could do actually more of a tool comparison with binary ninja guidera, Ida and well maybe right until we don't have the decompiler yet though Zach. Yeah. We fight I mean just the tool comparison in general, but I think we could do something with that\", \"start\": 986.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" taking out of had apparently snake. Does that sorts race does support it?\", \"start\": 1014.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Okay, then either the support came after I was working on it or I just didn't have that decompiler since I know you have I can't think of why my work with need the mips the compiler so I could imagine it also just wasn't paid for either way. I didn't have it through x-rays is what\", \"start\": 1017.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" he'll say. say Yeah, so now this this looks pretty cool. I probably will end up taking a look at this personally for maybe some like projects. I'm working on and stuff. So, you know, definitely one of the bring that up it does seem like there's been a lot of good and bad like quality of life improvements. And\", \"start\": 1035.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, we said we don't cover the releases Too Much Anymore compared to the first step. So it's with this one. I thought was a bit of a\", \"start\": 1052.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" standout. Yeah, so, you know, we've been talking about Ida and x-rays so we'll get into Ida home so ill fact Talk about a week ago or so tease the coming of Ida home, which was said to be a product that would address can common Community concerns around Ida, which you can tell right away if the price point because the future set of ideas pretty good. It's just far too expensive for most people so, you know this got some pipe people were thinking maybe we'll get I to with a decompiler for one architecture for a reduced price or something like that and it ended up being a disappointment. It basically ended up being Ida free but with i 2 pi, Thon and debugging swell four not five dollars a year\", \"start\": 1058.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" not even Ida free because you only have one processor family.\", \"start\": 1099.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So it's even worse than I have for you,\", \"start\": 1104.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" but I think you're basically paying for the Ida python is basically what you're paying three hundred and sixty five dollars a year for and you only get the annual payment.

I mean I saw this on Reddit, so it's going to Involved there, but you know the thing is I don't care. What I realized is. I don't think Ida has ever really had the Goodwill of the community. Ida has always been something as far as I've noticed. It's kind of just been something you begrudgingly have to use because it was the best thing available but nobody really liked x-rays as a company. Nobody really like the fact they were overcharging for it. And I mean as far as I can tell everybody's felt like they've been overcharging for this they've had the market Eminence and they've done nothing with it which is kind of the other thing. I mean, there isn't a law that you can kind of push with Ida that says our that shows how Ida has really innovated. I think at best you can pull out, you know, the wind graph the whole graphic system. I'm not sure this was before my time. I know the wind graph itself. Amen somewhere like the four dot something era so like early 2000 And I don't know if they were the first to do the graphing view or not.

NG is I don't feel like they've really innovate. They haven't really taken any good steps with that to be fair to them. They have had kind of that constant incremental upgrades. So I actually did go and look through the change long just to see if maybe I was missing something and people are definitely welcome to correct me on this. But as I was just kind of stepping through kind of the major releases and looking at the release information. There wasn't a ton the like, you know 6.0 with a big thing was the new GUI was using QT. Like our sorry, I think that might been 6.0. I pull it off. Yeah 6.1 though. It was like Android support utf-8 support 6.2. They had to GUI installer. If things like that, like, you know, especially jumping back on 6.1 with the font stuff like or with the text parsing like okay that makes sense to do. It's just nothing really stood out at any point. It's really being all that Innovative in the last, you know, 10 years. Maybe I'm mistaken on something. Maybe I just missed it, you know got stuck in my ways only using the features I use and that's it. But on the other hand though, you've got kedra which again, I mean, I'm not sure why I really pulled us being really Innovative with them, but they do have a good compiler. They don't have the Debugger, but what I will point out is binary ninja in the same price point as Idaho has plenty more offerings. In terms of that feature. Yeah, but the big thing in terms of like Innovation is that Intermediate Language the BNI else which right now they have the to the low-level the mid-level soon enough. They've been teasing it on Twitter is they'll have the high level which is effectively there decompiler.

Industry right side has a very simple like if tracks you greater than 0 XE and shows you like the ethanol so I could just some really simple rewriting of it. The mid-level one goes just a little bit. Little bit higher giving you variables giving you some of the function calls. Just some basic ideas that are but it's really useful when you're just scanning. The instructions to be able to look that and then on the other hand instead of having the decompiler the ILS at least, you know on the low level IL it's a very unlikely to be lying to you about what anything stealing where's compilers definitely make wrong assumption. So you can jump through these different levels and you know, once they have a decompiler something doesn't quite make sense you jump back.

So just in terms of like trying to innovate at least binary Ninja 'he is one they're cheaper to they are actually making some attempt to innovate with what they're doing. So I need at this price point. Yeah, go ahead. I was just gonna say at the price point the personal student version of this is like half the price of Idaho more support although on that note. It's not multi-threaded. I think do you have you have a personal license Specter? I have a personal yet. I don't know. So how has the performance been kind of?

I think they've added analysis caching to the personal version as well. So So, you know there is a bit of that. It's kind of like Dedra in a sense. There's a bit of a overhead on the initial analysis time. But once that's done, you know, the binary ninja database file is built and then it's like, you know when you open it in the future all that stuff's already done for you.

And I think that is you know, that kind of answers the question of why now like wire Ida kind of trying to Push for this I think it's safe to say Ghidorah as well as Vector 35 announcing that decompiler coming for Ben. Shh like you were talking about earlier could be spurring that on a little bit and I've also been noticing that people in the industry are starting to switch even people from these companies you were talking about earlier.

You know, the I to book was just some that you'd also pick up why because you're going to be using Ida. Maybe it was just a given that has definitely changed in the last several years, you know, there's definitely been punished for people just aren't like it?s still kind of considered the best option but your sufficient with Deidre your sufficient with binary ninja other more affordable options and from that with newcomers to the field starting to use those other tools eventually, you know, they become professionals. They're not using God. Ida so over time I think we can see either becoming relegated those kind of like Pearl those people that have used it all the time and never really moved on but those are kind of keeping up. Yeah, I've noticed the same thing people are starting to move away. It's not in huge numbers. It's not like flocks of people are just suddenly not using Ida and even when they are it's usually like they still have a night out license, but they're personally like their daily driver is something else.

I think we can move on to some exploits unless you have anything any final thoughts in sandbox on okay, so getting into some exploits.

So one of these packet types that you were mentioning that they were reversing can trigger a the one mesh service which ends up parsing a Json payload. Load that you give to it which contains like credentials and stuff like that. So the MAC address for the slave device is one of them and that Mac address is copied to the stack and is then copied into a command buffer through sprintf, which gets passed to system though. You can kind of see their you know, they go into more detail about all this trucks involved and all the functions of passes through but basically what it ends up boiling down to is the MAC address gets copied into a buffer that's then passed to system or concatenated into a buffer that's\", \"start\": 2403.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so it's placed placed into it. So it's placed into some lieu of code actually which ends up being called by System. But otherwise, you hit the key point there. It sends an encrypted blob of data that uses static encryption key that that's where the Jason's contained within it talks about something that talks about like their custom checksum method not entirely relevant to here as you said what's relevant though is it sends that Json object that could see Crabs that slave underscore Mac puts it into a variable and then here pulling up the coat relevant code. They'll see the s printf that as the system command had has that lieu of for matched. Well has the format string for the Mac equals and then for the Mac will go call system on it. So it's kind of in the middle fed. And that does come into play with how they actually solve this. But so when I say solve this one of the problems that they came up with is this looks like it would be a really straightforward. Command injection. It's calling system. You control some of the data going in there straightforward. The problem is that they're limited to about 12 bytes at a time because you know the size of a Mack itself plus their actual Escape so you can escape this as long as it's not doing a validation on the Mac, which it's not you can escape that with just the quotient semicolon, which is effectively what they do. They do the single quote to get out of the luau. Bat her to get off the Lua code semicolon and then whatever their payload is and then they'll kind of recreate the string. Basically, they'll come the last single quote is so the extra characters that are appended don't invalidate the command itself or don't kind of cause any issues with that.

Yeah print er, sorry building up the file one character at a time that requires 11 bite still one character. And then they show how I try to do a character that gets interpreted by the shell. You can't just do that with the printf without quotes. You need a quote. Whatever that character is. So you can you don't have enough bites left actually append.

The emulator which basically reintroduced the bug and the reason it's called the EU debug is EU d stands for extended unit death and it was it was basically a parser bug in the map scripts that allowed relative read write and basically arbitrary right if you factor in where it's you know reading and writing to her sir bug or\", \"start\": 2816.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" just like the one value just wasn't validated so when it would access an array, so it was a death counter. So you had these death counters that would track like Like how the player which player and how many of each type of unit, they killed or destroyed or whatever. I haven't played Starcraft. So I apologize if I keep some wrong terms of but essentially you had that it would use just that unit type wasn't getting validate. So check the player ID. But Unity, you could basically provide any value into this actor. I guess. It's also important to mention that part of this comes down to the maps kind of supporting some scripting so people can Had their own story or introduce new game modes, and that's where people are able to set up and some actions that happen in response to things like in response some of the deaths. So in this case, I'll see if you can control one element of the array like what one index you're able to get to access anywhere in that array. Or certainly any we're kind of in memory if you're able to control that array index.\", \"start\": 2868.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yes, so abounds\", \"start\": 2934.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" access. Yeah, so you're able to get to increment or compare values except you're basically this is a specter already mentioned a reader. I get it anywhere to memory.

So, you know, it doesn't really matter and that's not too much of a surprise. I mean the game is pretty old. So I was I'd probably be surprised if it was position independent, but what I thought was cool about this too was he actually ended up turning this bug into a CTF challenge for the Midnight Sun qualifiers that happened this year. So, you know, it's one of those things you can see like a game exploit and those are those are decently common to try to pour it into cpf challenges just because it's kind of a a unique area. It's not explored to too much. You don't see too much about it. So and it's more fun. I think to exploit games is kind of you know, brings two things together that makes it a lot more fun.\", \"start\": 2954.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, although usually like getting into position to do that as also a bit more of a challenge with the game challenges.

They said that the bug was exposed in a safe Manner and I'm not really sure what they mean by that. They said old fussed old fun custom maps can be played again without exposing yourself to memory corruption attacks, and I don't really see how that's the case because if the bug survived then how is it like a safe manner or how would you not be exposing yourself to memory corruption? If this is a memory corruption issue, I'm not really sure what they meant by that and I'm not sure.

We always cover but getting back into some, you know, more serious ones we have. Oh my Zetas H, which is a DOT end remote code execution and it's basically due to falsely trusting environment. Variables in the dot end plug in or not environment variables but environment files. So what ends up happening is when you see D into a project directory this plug-in will end up sourcing any environment files that finds in the directory and this it does this without prompting or notifying the user or anything.\", \"start\": 3075.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So, I believe there's a malicious.

You don't have to remember to do that all the time yourself that said so our study and be like are just using Source the command source. Actually executes the file not just loads environment variables. So if you have a malicious one that has codon and not just environment variables. It'll execute code and will do that automatically. So definitely a concern and I definitely like a lot of people would be using this to because it is useful. I don't use that shell or zi shell or whichever it is.

It's not going to serve its purpose. It's technically there but it's not going to serve the purpose that was set out for so that's where I think you know, if they prompted just on the first use of it. And then trusted it after that. I think that would be a fair way to go about it.\", \"start\": 3312.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, like that's a good point from chat pone. The Gibson said max are is zi sh bit of default now, which yeah, actually I completely forgot about that but you're right. I remember the last time I know it's been a little while but the last time I went on my back I noticed that too it is that Ice Age so good. That's a good point. Thanks for bringing that up. But yeah, you know kind of a kind of a short little write-up. It's not a overly complex. Issue, but it does exist. So one of them bring up what we'll get into semantic web Gateway. So there was a white paper on packet Storm from Cody 16 and it's a nicely laid out paper that has sections on some environment information bug information. I kind of like how it was laid out and it's part of a miniseries. He's doing called hunting 0 days, which is it's kind of like a journal of real-world 0 days that he's came across and how he found them and whatnot. It sounds like an interesting concept. This one covers in are seeing the semantic web Gateway the you know, kind of stipulation of that is it can only be hit by authorized user? So the impact is pretty limited there. Well, that'd but at the\", \"start\": 3360.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" same time. I mean, you've got a web interface you don't expect them to have code execution, especially when we're talking about like this some that's going to be used by Like I believe that some that would be used more on like the Enterprise level and not something that's super consumer-focused. Hmm. So in that case like they're going to want to have more protection like it's still something we're untrusted people may not have full access but it still kind of\", \"start\": 3424.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" matters. It's still a privilege\", \"start\": 3452.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" escalation. Yeah, I mean granted the type of person who I has this level of access probably has access just on the server itself, but\", \"start\": 3453.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I mean you will be able to track down anybody who exploits this most likely just by you know, checking access logs and stuff like that.

So very like the most straightforward. Word command injection, you can get basically we've got a lot of command injections on this show. I just realize if you know, it's that's like our vulnerability class of the week. But anyway, you know, you can basically just use that to get a shell issue fairly straightforward, but I think it's cool that the guys trying to give some insight into the process, you know saying about like, you know, this is why I did this, you know, we always like to show those out just because those\", \"start\": 3464.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" dead included the full\", \"start\": 3518.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" process. Yeah, exactly. The impact is limited because you do need need an authorized user to pull it off.

So one of the give it a bit of the Shadow\", \"start\": 3520.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" our last, yang actually I will just mention. Yeah now with that just for those of you listening.

So our last exploit we don't have too much information on it's a VMware security advisory. It's it's an improved disclosure and the VMware directory service. We don't have technical details, but there is a bit of weirdness around it because it has a cdss three score of ten and nine point eight on the cve which Very high for what your typical information disclosure would be.\", \"start\": 3561.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so we might\", \"start\": 3586.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" usually isn't just a memory leak that can use to you know, well so that I don't\", \"start\": 3587.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" think this is in memory leak at all. I don't think it's that type of information disclosure. I think this is more likely disclosing some sort of token or even credentials that are used for communication between different services. That would be my guess just because it is a 10 point O or 9.8. Looking at the CV itself your CIA our confidentiality integrity and availability. They're all rated High usually with information disclosure. It's just information. So it's just confidentiality. Maybe maybe medium may be high, but you won't be able to impact Integrity or availability of the service. So the fact that that's all being changed their makes me think. Some sort of authentication or authorization information information that could directly be used to modify everything else which they kind of mention. It's highly sensitive information which could be used to compromise the vcenter server or other services which are dependent upon the Ender for authentication. So, yeah, we don't have the details on it, but I figured I'd one called out because I'm sure some of you are. It's using VMware and also just because we it is a little bit weird to see an information disclosure with such a high\", \"start\": 3591.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" rating. Yeah, it may be worth patch to thing for anyone interested in doing that kind of stuff.

I don't know how much cells weapon patch the same time.\", \"start\": 3688.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I don't know that. Yeah, I'm not too familiar with VMware and like how they roll out updates and stuff. So let that's it your point but you know, it could be something that somebody might be interested in doing we'll move into some research though. Our first one is on bypassing modern xss mitigations with code reuse attacks, which is kind of cool. I haven't really heard of code reviews being used in a web context. Apparently. It's been a while around for a while since 2017 according to the article which is something fairly recent. And\", \"start\": 3694.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I'm 2017 to still pretty recent one comes to research. I mean, yeah, it was actually kind of new to me. Also, I mean technically so you've already matched this isn't new but at the same time it's a little bit different from my usual approach when dealing with CSP. It's usually looking for some weakness in the CSP header itself that lets you, you know inject something like defines what object or how you're going to get your code in there. Just some weakness. that whereas this Dimension is kind of about code reuse the idea of finding gadgets and existing libraries and reusing those in your injection to get around like if you have a CSP policy, you know restricted to only sell for something you'd find some Gadget or how to find Gadgets in. In the libraries that are already being used and reusing those for yourself. Like it's an interesting attack or interesting method. Yeah.\", \"start\": 3724.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I liked how they had some examples. They have an example of like an HTML page that sets a HTML element with a get parameter and shows how like the see it the CSP could be bypass. Their first example is a little bit contrived but it's something like if the page has a calculator you can use the Expression in that to inject existing page content somewhere else. At that excess us.\", \"start\": 3784.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, they do that. Obviously, they move right on from talking about that really simple case to using jQuery mobile. Yes, you include that library and you're able and the kind of they show a gadget from if you go to the 2017 paper, which they link they include kind of more information about some different gadgets and other\", \"start\": 3807.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" libraries. But if you look they also they have like some examples of like the gadgets the types of gadgets you could use to bypass CSP and web application firewalls and stuff like that. So they mention let me just go to it so I can\", \"start\": 3827.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, well search string manipulation Gadget element construction function creation JavaScript execution sync gadgets and gadgets and expression\", \"start\": 3845.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" parsers. Yeah, so, you know, they they gave that real-world. But I thought this was really cool because when you hear code reuse you always think binary and this kind of makes you rethink that that hey you could use that in the web context as well and it absolutely makes sense and it brings kind of that new way of thinking to web which I always thought. I've always found web a little bit boring because it always seems like okay copy and paste from a cheat sheet if it works. Okay, cool. If it doesn't move on to something else, that's how I've kind of seen web for a while. But this kind of challenge is that thinking this Is this is bringing some of that binary thought process into web which I thought was like really cool and and it was new to me as well. Like obviously, you know, 2017 is when it was introduced, but it was new to me and I think it you said earlier to is new to you as well.\", \"start\": 3854.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So yeah, so I think it actually like 2017 was first paper on it. I think you can trace this back a little bit further. I couldn't give you dates on it. I think the paper actually gives credit to another source though also. Oh God,\", \"start\": 3903.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but you know, I think it's still like very it's We not very well known I think maybe we\", \"start\": 3917.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" know that's why I didn't want to\", \"start\": 3922.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" tax in the future.\", \"start\": 3924.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I think part of it though is I mean csps have been you know, just increasing in adoption. They haven't been well used in the past. No or well supported by the browsers either like so that's where I could see this kind of coming up to be more useful to be thinking about this kind of going forward and having some systems that will maybe remove gadgets from your code\", \"start\": 3926.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" automatically. Yeah.\", \"start\": 3949.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But yeah, it was definitely kind of like you get the concept like as soon as you say by passing modern excess mitigations with code reuse text. Like when you mention excess and code reuse like you get you kind of get the initial idea of what they're doing. Hmm, the paper goes into more detail while finding actual gadgets. But yeah, it's not something I've needed to do before or really looked at before so it was new to me.\", \"start\": 3953.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" One thing. I will touch on there as you were saying csb hasn't In much adoption, but where I think it's cool to is this can bypass more than just CSP you can use this to bypass web application firewalls. Like they were saying and I think those had seen an like increase adoption. I think web application firewalls are like pretty popular now aren't they? Like they've picked up a lot of adoption over the last five years haven't they?\", \"start\": 3979.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" um I kind of like through cloudflare through some of the CDN offerings. Yes.\", \"start\": 4002.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So, you know, it could be useful for getting around those and that that could also be spurring on potentially seeing more of these the style of attack being used in the future. So, you know, maybe we'll see it in CTS to maybe give you the first but yeah, not too much more to say on that.\", \"start\": 4012.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well on the CTF note, I was actually looking at extending your excessive alert challenge with CSP.\", \"start\": 4029.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Oh, that could be\", \"start\": 4038.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fun. I was looking at that and then I realized that even though you have the includes for the jQuery stuff. You don't actually include the file so they can't get\", \"start\": 4039.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" loaded. Ha ha look at that secure. I challenge that secure but ya know that could be cool. What do you think like modifying the initial Challenger making\", \"start\": 4047.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it I want well so my initial thought was to do it. Like I did with the prng wind where it doesn't fix the version. Yeah. Okay. That's why I was looking at updating your accessible loved one and making a fixed or less success of\", \"start\": 4058.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" alerts. Hey, that could be fun. I think that's a good idea. But with that we'll move on to Our next research topic. So our next one is practical data poisoning attacks against next item recommendation though. This paper proposes a system called Loki guessing, you know, the god of tricks and or Norse mythology. That's probably where they came up with the name because I couldn't find it doesn't seem to be an acronym and it's you know, the system is being proposed for doing data poisoning attacks against black box recommendation systems and what I mean by recommendation systems is you know, Shopping sites, for example where they recommend items to you based on reviews and purchase history and you know the example they go through with is Amazon basically and their system is going to use machine learning to train the attack agent and how they do that is by using a simulator to get around the restrictions you'd have with typical real-world recommendation systems. So they basically run a simulator with a data set. So the example they use is like the Amazon beauty product section. They take like a bunch. Those and and basically make a simulator for that recommendation system and then they try to poison that system which uses a history of like the users actions and stuff like that certain interests and make connections between them and the key paragraph that summarizes what they're doing for some reason I forgot to write down the page number. So I don't know if you could search this one I'm talking about it, but they say the intuition behind such a design is that if to recommend recommenders can both get similar recommendation results and it Given data set the adversarial samples generated for one of the recommended recommenders can be used to attack the other so to pull off this attack. They assumed the attacker can see the full history of all the users in the system. They assume they can inject a limited number of controlled users and that they're hitting a black box system and at the attacker can only receive minimal feedback. They can't see for example, when the Target Model is retrained for testing this they tested against like the Amazon Beauty. It's like I was talking about\", \"start\": 4072.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" before I do want to jump in and just mention I do feel like one of those things the access to the full activity user of all our sorry full activity history of all users in the recommendation list at is a high condition. That seems like a really high condition everything else seems like they're taking as like what can somebody outside do you know, the limited number of control users not knowing the details limited feedback that one just seems so out of place for everything else like not knowing the details. Tales about the target system, but they know the full activity history.\", \"start\": 4199.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It does kind of go against her black box approach.\", \"start\": 4232.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, like everything else seems okay, just that one. Like I'm not sure if maybe I was just a misunderstanding how they were using that or something. But that one really stood out\", \"start\": 4235.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to me. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bit weird. But you know when they did their testing they ended up seeing that they could force a display rate of up to 0.5 at 15 activities per user and those are fairly decent results. I mean 50% is quite a lot if you're hitting something. Like Amazon, for example, so, you know, it's kind of interesting hitting like recommendation systems and using machine learning, you know, kind of using AI to attack Ai and a way I think that's kind of cool. But like you were saying that is a good point though that you know, that is a very high conditional consider is considering their whole methodology behind the paper as being able to hit Black Box system though. Yeah. That is that is a bit weird.\", \"start\": 4244.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. That's why I wasn't sure if maybe I was misunderstanding and they only I need like the full history of their controlled subjects or something like that. But it like it does say\", \"start\": 4288.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" all users of all users. Yeah. So, you know, that's a good point overall though. I thought the paper was kind of interesting. So, you know, one of the bring up our next paper though, I think is far more interesting and it's on the defense side and it's about Hardware Trojan detection using controlled circuit aging so how they propose to do that is basically using transistor aging to try to detect Hardware back doors and Trojans. So this paper is pretty technical it gets into the hardware level, but essentially what they're proposing is that when the voltage of a Sir goes from high to low. It causes short-term Aging in that transistor and when this happens the current that goes through it is reduced which causes a switching delay which delays timings and causes timing errors in the integrated circuits. And what they do is use machine learning to try to learn the bit error patterns produced from a known clean. I see and then they do the same thing against a potentially malicious I see and compare the results.\", \"start\": 4298.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so I mean maybe I was just distracted for a moment.

That's\", \"start\": 4372.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" okay. Well, I don't want to go too far in depth with that. I was just going to make mention of effectively they find a way to artificially aged the circuit and then they use also over overclocking to kind of result in some higher delays when doing that and then it's the difference that they're finding like the difference in those bit flips the difference in the errors that happen when there's a region versus when there's not a\", \"start\": 4375.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Trojan checking for side effects\", \"start\": 4402.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" based. Yeah, and I thought this is the interest paper not because I totally understood everything here. But because this is an issue that I've known really thought about obviously it exists it matters. It's not in an area that I deal with like I don't deal with hardware at all. John are you I'm really knowledgeable in and but it is an area that like it matters. It's not something I've thought about but it was still kind of interesting like, you know, this is what they're doing. And this is what they're thinking about in terms of trying to detect those Hardware implants those Trojans.\", \"start\": 4404.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I'm getting into some results when they tested their setup. They ended up testing against some Trojan circuits from trust Hub. So they provide like Trojan circuits for testing for Or like these kinds of projects and they tested against three circuits the basic RS 80 100 a AST 100 and the AST 1000 and when they tested they ended up finding that they had a 99% detection rate against those circuits. So it seems to be like really promising and how accurate it is. That being said they did only test against those three benchmarking circuits. So it is pretty limited. It would be cool to see it. It's results against other circuits, though. That's pretty difficult like getting your hands on like known Trojan circuits is probably not too easy to do so, I don't blame them for that. But you know just know that that test results that is a little bit limited. So you might want to take that 99 percent figure with a you know, grain of salt.\", \"start\": 4437.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It's a long. Otherwise that was that 99% is a very good\", \"start\": 4495.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" result. Oh, yeah sure. It's a long paper. It goes pretty low-level. Like obviously you're dealing with Hardware stuff. But Hardware stuff is always fun to talk about because it's almost like dark magic in a way. A lot of people don't really understand the some of the implications that can happen at that level and using stuff like voltage and current and overclocking and stuff like that to detect these errors and bit flips. Like it's such a low level that like 99% of people do not think about and that's what kind of makes it cool. You know, what it highlights the fact that with Hardware even the most benign things can hold valuable information, which is why it's such an interesting research area. So, you know, definitely One of the bring that up. It's a cool. It's a very fun paper, but it is like it's not incredibly accessible. You can get that higher level view like we did but unless you're like familiar with hardware and the math and some of the you know science at that lower level. You might struggle getting some of the more intricate details of it. Just you know, just as a fair warning I guess. Did you have any final thoughts on that paper though?\", \"start\": 4498.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" See? No, I mean I didn't even try to get the deeper understanding of it to be honest for all my took this as you know, it's interesting area. I haven't seen much on this got the high level understanding of what's going on, but I didn't even try to dig too deep into it.\", \"start\": 4564.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so we'll move on to our final topic and it's aptly named a final security bug. Oh you're bringing up duct tape though.\", \"start\": 4580.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I've brought that up. Because you accidentally brought this paper up when you switch topics. Don't worry about it.\", \"start\": 4591.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Oh fair enough. So it describes a gang Google tanks Ed to five five one nine Java implementation,\", \"start\": 4597.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" which is all those three really private Keys really important to mention that this did not make it into the release version of tank, which is their kind of easy to use crypto Library significant bug did not make it into an actual thing. So like no empath It was actually found like in 2017 and patch in 2017. Yeah, I just this is the first time it's being written up. I believe he's presenting about this actually at some conference is that Thomas come up on my I-Car feed the cryptography feed. So I think there's some crypto conference at this will be presented at\", \"start\": 4604.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if the conference happens, you know, it's very close good to see it canceled. Maybe yeah, but they describe they first described add to five five one nine, which I haven't really heard of but it's basically an Edwards curve digital signature algorithm which uses sha-256 and curve to five five one nine. That's where those stitches come from there. They praised it quite a bit. They say it was designed with excellent security engineer because iteration so\", \"start\": 4645.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well, so the guy writing this from Google ting Google tank is from Google. I feel like there might be some bias here that said I can't I can't really say that they're not yeah that said like I Googled definitely hires good. People so I'm gonna assume it's true. Like I I'm going to kind of pointing that out ingest the more than out of a sort of serious issue with anybody\", \"start\": 4672.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" involved. Yeah, so she was not a bug that's like, you know a design flaw in the algorithm. It's actually in the implementation and the issue is when they sign the message they pass the message the public key and the hash private key and these arguments should not be changed by the collie function. And this is signaled by using the final keyword. The problem is these parameters are raised and the contents of these Rays can be changed without raising errors, even though it's declared as final because they kind of misunderstood how final worked\", \"start\": 4696.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well so it's more I actually even want to put the blame or towards Java on this one. So if you're a c programmer, you're familiar const Char star constant a character array pointer, but when you use that The array itself the contents of it you can't modify it that's the idea of using the constant. A Java doesn't have an equivalent to that Java has this final which if you're not intimately familiar with the Java you my you'd be forgiven for thinking it's you know, the same thing is constant, but it's not that Specter saying it ends up protecting it basically saying like you can only assign a value to this variable or this field wants So it assigns the pointer value basically for the array doesn't act protect the content of it just kind of that initial pointer assignment for and that's kind of how Java does it? So as he's mentioning in Malad which just does like a basic competent or like a modular arithmetic on it? that ends up it passes in the hash private key twice to that function which ends up modifying the message and all I hear you kind of get back to what you were saying\", \"start\": 4730.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah the issue is because the collie can modify the parameter and it ends up modifying the hash private key and the first 32 bytes of that key is published and that means if you get two messages signed with the same key you can compute the private key see by using an equation to eliminate the modifications that were done to the hatch private key so they have a I think page for they have some those equations that you could use obviously I'm not a I'm not a crypto person I'm not a math major so I don't fully understand these equations but the fact is you know you can end up calculating the differences it's cool paper it is a little bit it's pretty mathy like some of the previous papers we've\", \"start\": 4810.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" covered it is I mean the key thing though is just that Final aspect like the fact that the values are getting modified ends up reusing this modified value. So the first time through a calculates signature correctly the second time through that hash private key is actually saved its kind of cash and that's where that second time through because it got modified it ends up using a different value and then you kind of figure things out from there. So it does go into the math but really the key thing there that I thought was interest was just the fact the issue was this trust in final which is where I kind of I'm down on Jabba for not having something equal to the constant in like C++ and c.\", \"start\": 4854.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think I'd agree with that. Yeah, I'd agree with that. It's cool. Right like it just shows like even if you're like a super smart person who's like really good with crypto with when you're getting into the implementation level. Even if it's done by experts in the field. It's still very easy to make very subtle mistakes and you know that ends up getting an attacker is We an oracle into your crypto. Yes. Yes, not something you ever want them to\", \"start\": 4895.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" have something that was mentioned here was even doing the standard test but using like all the standard test cases wouldn't have discovered this and didn't discover this because the standard test would just check like case the signature just running it once this is a signature result correctly.

Yeah, kind of lends Credence to that fact that especially when you're talking about crypto and a library that is from somebody like Google that a lot of people are going to use. You're probably going to want to write your unit tests more like you want to test with a lot more edge cases and try to be more aggressive and testing I guess on that because if they were they might have caught this issue, you know what I\", \"start\": 4943.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" mean?

Repeat this was caught pre-release. This was an audit being done before they release that so it was caught but yeah, like what it could have been caught in during development, you know doing more being more tests at that point and I would imagine they immediately added in a regression tests to cover this. Anyhow,\", \"start\": 4971.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, so, you know, this is a really cool insight into you know crypto stuff which again like Hardware is kind of like a dark magic area, so Definitely a fun read I want to bring up from chat.
