I'm Specter with me a zi welcome to the Star Wars edition of the day Zero podcast. No, the reason I'm saying that is Happy Star Wars day to anybody who celebrates that I know we're a few minutes late today because we've been having some fun technical issues both on our side and on Twitches side. It seems to which apis having some issues right now and and also apologies if like at some points, I sound a little bit, you know unenthused compared to normal on the podcast because I do have a bit of a headache that just sprung up before the It's like everything's trying to compound today. So it's been a fun day for for pre stream, but we will jump into talking about some stuff before we get into news though. I think we'll do a bit of a summary on decompilers because over the last couple weeks. We've been talking a lot about the Benja decompiler that recently dropped and during last week. We were analyzing the realize decompiler on we did a stream about So I think we want to do like a summary of some of the points that we had for both realize and Benja and we figured we'd kind of you know, plug that in to the beginning of this\", \"start\": 9.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" episode just a quick summary there. So I mean we don't think most people are going to be too enthused about watching. How know what do we have eight nine hours? Where's the streaming between the two of them? I think\", \"start\": 73.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" both it's very rare for a hours. Yeah, both of them were almost four hours on the nose. So yeah, they were quite long strange and part of the reason for that is we had a lot of discussion with Benji Deb the joined us for both streams, which is really cool. There's actually some really insightful discussion there for anybody wants to check out the vod's maybe it is worth like going back and clipping some of those discussions because some people might find them interesting. But yeah, it is like it did they are quite long. Strained so we are going to do like a bit of a summary here though. I think we'll start with realize just because we covered that this week. So some of the points that we noticed. So we I have a few like a negative and positive points that were summarized from the street before\", \"start\": 88.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you jump to the points. I do want to offer one correction on something I'd say that last time we were talking about realize which was just about being able to copy out code apparently that you can do it. And like I said, I figured that was probably a user what was it was? It was a right click and then it was under a submenu. I think you would found\", \"start\": 129.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it Specter. Yeah. Yeah the right click on it and it was copy as text or something like that.\", \"start\": 148.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think it was still under a sub menu yet, then copy us text or export. I think\", \"start\": 153.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" ya might have been export. Yeah, I mean to say what you were saying layered with like user are kind of a user error, but at the same time I think that is very unintuitive. And that is one thing I found with realize is there there's a few things that should be more. More intuitive to the user experience that are not so you can do them. But you have to kind of go digging to know that you can do them the know how to do them though. I do think there needs to be some work on the unlike the UI and the ux there to make realize more intuitive to use but I guess I'll jump into some of the points. So first I'll cover some of the things that I found were an issue. One of them was structure accesses wouldn't get Rewritten. You change the type of a variable to a structure. So if you you know by default when you have an array or sorry not an array, if you have a structure it gets written as an array in the decompiler output. But in Binger, for example, if you change the type of that variable from an array to a structure it will rewrite all the accesses on that whereas realize doesn't actually do that. So there's a bit of a bit of a weird thing there where it doesn't rewrite the decompiler. I put the other thing I found was the casting was sinus was Wrong, sometimes they don't have any constant propagation. So while they allow you to use enumerated types, they don't really do anything and the the biggest gripe. I think that I had with it was with C++ stuff last member names work, but you can't use the standard Library when you define classes for your types though. The problem with that is if you have a class for something to reversing that has like a, you know standard lib string or Anything like that, like a vector a string anything like that. You're not going to be able to put that into realize at least I couldn't seem to get it in there.\", \"start\": 158.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's definitely like an annoying part of it at the same time. Like I'm sure some of those structures are going to be quite complex for them to just kind of filled in\", \"start\": 272.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" but at the same time standard lid is pretty\", \"start\": 285.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" calm. Yeah. I know I completely agree like it's I've so I don't actually know. What like I'd s support is for that. Do you know offhand? I haven't done a ton of C++ re\", \"start\": 287.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, I'm not into C++. Sorry. I actually hate it. So I haven't really tried it and I to either so that is a fair point. I don't know how hex raise handles that it might have the same issue or might not even like it might be even worse. I can't speak on that and I think when we did Benja we kind of neglected the C++ a little bit more. So to be fair to realize it could just be something that I noticed. On the realized stream, but I didn't really test much on some other decompilers. So there could be a bit of a bias there overall though. There were some positives with realize for sure for one. It had some really nice optimization on dead functions and it was so nice. Actually that I wanted to double-check that it wasn't overly aggressive which it wasn't in my tests. They have a really nice filter search panel, which I really liked you can do like a filter search and search all the columns and stuff like that. It's a little bit more. It's kind of like deidre's search actually, and I think the other thing is that handled stock checks Earth's like stack cookie checks really? Well. So sometimes like binary ninja would leave out stack cookie checks, which is submit them Deidre would sometimes just a bit them or would like mess up the analysis, but with realized they were like they're plain as day it even had a little bit of constant propagation with that as well. So yeah overall they had some positives Were a few negatives but like we were saying on the stream realizes one of those things where the decompiler at least for free just dropped and it's more mature than binary ninja C compiler like as in it's been around for longer but it's not as old as x-rays, you know what I mean? So I don't expect it to compete with x-rays yet. You know, I don't think it's at that level. So since we've kind of summarized realized there I will give some like our bit of a recap on some of the binges stuff. If and what it did better than realize which was and handled rewriting better for decompiling. It was more intuitive to use because the ux I think was was done better on Benja and there was constant propagation though. It was a little bit too aggressive. But yeah, I can't remember if it had the C++ class stuff like like realized it. I can't\", \"start\": 303.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" sell. I don't believe we really tried with that. I think we played around with some vtable stuff and Some of that just see how the decompiler handled it but not so much at the structure level and just using using it so I can't speak offhand for that. I will say that one things you liked with the dead code elimination was basically when it would take a function that did nothing but returned a constant and basically just pop that in place and binge it does do the same thing.\", \"start\": 442.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so I mean, I think I will go back this week and check out Benja and see if it does that class stuff. I'm not going to do a stream on it because it's just one thing. I want to check and then I'll probably do like a correction next stream or like, you know, addendum or whatever. But yeah, I think we're going to also write a more detailed blog post at some point that breaks the stuff down more and gives examples and stuff like that. I also haven't published that Corpus repository that I was working on. So I got a fix like clean that up a little bit and push. That out. So there we are going to be doing a blog post more structured blog post on it\", \"start\": 471.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" soon. Yeah, probably targeting closer to after Benja stable has the decompiler.\", \"start\": 506.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, it's which\", \"start\": 514.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is I think kind of coming towards the end of the month or so\", \"start\": 515.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" IE, I think end of May was when they were aiming for so yeah, so we'll do that more structured blog post to take a look out for that. But if you want to, you know, see some of our thoughts and insights on it before that blog post goes out the twitch mods will be up for a little while. I think usually they stop stay up for at least 30 days. So the binge of one is a little bit older but the realized one will be up for a while so you can check those out while they're still up and I think I will Like a stream cut on the YouTube channel for anybody who wants some of the highlights from that basically, but with that said well, we'll move on to some news. We actually only have one news topic poor we jump in and some exploits this week and it's kind of a follow-up to soar as we talked about before with the NSO group and Facebook. So there's a lawsuit going on Facebook is suing me Anna so group I think over there WhatsApp stuff they're claiming but NSO group basically breached WhatsApp Ooh the through vulnerability that they're well by where you sit there are a\", \"start\": 520.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" few different things that kind of go into that. I believe it actually comes up with there's two because you have to remember breaching that's criminal. That's not something that you're going to be sued in Civil Court over that's like cfaa started Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Oh whereas this is more if their Civil Court, I believe it does mention. Kind of the specifics of where what they were suing over. That's it. I only really want to talk about a couple. A couple of things that kind of come up out of this or come up out of NSO groups most recent filing. I'll know what you had to mention by one of the things was this comment on immunity. We're NSO group is basically arguing that because their customers are government. They're effectively immune to any sort of litigation. Now it mentions here, you know, the whether or not sovereign immunity applies to them. I think that might actually like I think they might be being to refer to State immunity which applies to kind of foreign governments that said, I'm not a\", \"start\": 579.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" lawyer you're not a lawyer. So,\", \"start\": 659.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know, this is purely just us\", \"start\": 661.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" talking about it.\", \"start\": 663.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" No, no real understanding of all the legal stuff, but I did find that kind of an interesting idea that as a company if they're selling to a government there somehow possibly immune\", \"start\": 665.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that seems weird to me like why?\", \"start\": 678.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I know. I think I never\", \"start\": 680.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" meant sin Force the law doesn't mean they're above it and turns like well, so at\", \"start\": 681.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" least with sovereign immunity though is pretty much exactly that the governor because all criminal charges. Our because you can sell you can sue the government. I believe I'm actually not completely certain about that. I know you can see what I believe. You can see two parts of the government such as like the doj when somebody's been imprisoned and then probably yeah like that falsely imprison that said I'm not sure about the actual government. But when you go into criminal court, it's always, you know, and the u.s. It's the u.s. Versus whoever's been. With something so taking you know, the u.s. To Criminal Court is you know, the u.s. Versus the US so many you caught you can kind of understand where some of me when he comes in like you might be able to apply to some specific individuals but not to the government itself. So at least that's some idea of the immunity and then like I mentioned the state immunity is just basically kind of a truce between countries that you're not going to start suing each other or charging each other. kind of at that level which I mean a country doesn't really have the ability to enforce anything against the other country. Anyhow. Yes, so I mean nobody sends does make some sense. It's just you know one is NSO group because they're you know, you can look them as kind of being NSR government contractors. They also mentioned that you know, they don't run the Pegasus software for their clients. So Any of the actions involved wouldn't have been from\", \"start\": 686.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" them. Yeah, I think that's like their big argument. Right as they're arguing that you know, they the cfaa they're arguing only applies to unauthorized access not\", \"start\": 795.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so that's that's actually separate argument. So there's two things going on here. There's the immunity claim they're claiming that their immune and\", \"start\": 807.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" then the other one is the one I was just saying with\", \"start\": 816.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yes. Yeah. It's just it's separate, you know. Them not running Pegasus doesn't really matter with that. But yeah, as you are saying well the comments in here is an A so group and sis, it cannot have violated America's Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because it had authorization to send messages via WhatsApp. And this is kind of warmth comes I thought was most interesting. First of all, it is always worth mentioning when it comes to the law. There is a judge. Usually that's actually interpreting. The law or you know a jury you don't get to just play around on Al off the really minor technicalities when something is written in a way that makes it somewhat obvious. He's Deuce. There are still technicalities, of course that lawyers can play around with but and I do think this one might actually be one of those cases. It's an interesting point being that they were authorized to send messages because no compromise at least that was brought up initially. Involved what's app servers besides just WhatsApp facilitating the compromise it was compromising. Somebody's phone ignoring the fact that NFL claim that they don't run the software. It would have been somebody else actually doing that. You know the idea being they're allowed to send messages, you know, what's up terms of service doesn't prevent them from sending malicious messages.\", \"start\": 818.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, they basically you all they did was send to the wrong kind of messages over. What's up servers? Yeah. Um, so I mean it's an interesting argument. Like you said it is, you know, it is getting like pretty into the technicality weeds. But like what's interesting, especially when you're talking about like the legal system in court.\", \"start\": 911.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" You're talking\", \"start\": 930.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" about technology is most judges there probably are certain judges that are you know, kind of cut out for technical stuff. But for the most part judges aren't really going to appreciate those technicality, like technical differences differences just because they're not overly familiar with like the exploitation area, you know, it's kind of one of those areas where you have to be familiar with it to be able to understand all the intricacies of what's going on. Yeah. It's not like an everyday thing that you know a judge or a jury wouldn't counter in their everyday life. No, but that pretty Niche that's the point of expert witnesses to\", \"start\": 931.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" explain that to the judge to explain that to the jury so that they are able to understand what they need to about it. I want expect the judge to understand it. I would expect a judge or jury to listen to an expert witness who explain some of those details to them. I wouldn't think that the law can't be upheld because a judge doesn't know that like a they don't need to know. Are they don't need to already go in there with that information? They just need to be able to listen to? Presumably an expert acting in good faith.\", \"start\": 965.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So I mean like you said like neither of us are really lawyers. I don't think we can speak to the you know effective how effective these arguments are or anything like that. But the reason we wanted to bring it up was like this is this is probably going to be a Bedrock case for future Computer Fraud and Abuse acts because you know, the way the legal system is from what I understand is a lot of cases are built on top of other cases. It's kind of like a brick wall and each case\", \"start\": 1002.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" precedent close. Yeah.\", \"start\": 1026.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, you gonna putting a brick in that wall and everything after Kind of, you know will reference that case and I think this is going to be one of those Bedrock cases. That's that's going to be used in future lawsuits.\", \"start\": 1027.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's kind of just in the US the legal system is very precedent based where if there's kind of the past presidents for doing something a judge and needs a reason to deviate from the decision of another core. Well now Tiffany equal court, but as I'm sure whatever happens it's going to get a peeled either way. It says as it moves its way up the court sky has that the precedent get set. That's at other countries don't quite work like that like precedents has less of a meaning.\", \"start\": 1038.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, that was said to keep like an eye on it and see how it goes in the\", \"start\": 1071.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" future. Yes, definitely a major case for the time and we talked about a previous least figure we give cough and other update and it was actually I believe Razzie. Woo that actually dropped a link for us in the\", \"start\": 1075.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Discord. So we'll move into some exploits. Our first one is command injection and that sweeper. So this was posted on SSD disclosure though. It was reported through them, but the vendor rejected and ignored the reports apparently to this day. So I don't know what's going on there. Like it's just weird that they're just rejecting it. So they decided to do a full disclosure which is kind of interesting will probably get to that later on after we cover the issue. Actually, it seems the issue is that they have a vulnerable endpoint which takes a log in a password and a timeout and then it checks the referer header against an array of like different valid endpoints. And if the refers in that array, it executes command using the login and password variables and the password variables seems to just get concatenated into a string passed to the python interpreter for doing crypto.\", \"start\": 1089.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well injected into the string and pull up the code here. Yeah. It's kind of in the middle there. It's the dollar sign too. Because it gets it gets sent like they do escape the password. So obviously the PHP endpoint that the submit to they escape both the login the user name or and the password and they send those two things as arguments to the service that sh file. And in that service that sh file though, it takes the second argument the password passes it into python Crypt to try and generate like the proper hash for it. Which then you can of course just\", \"start\": 1143.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" escaped right from you know, do the\", \"start\": 1188.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" basically finish out the command there with another single quote kolding or comma and go on from there.

I found weird. I don't know if you can answer this see because I Tried reading through the right up to see if I missed something and I couldn't really find it. If you look at the code snippet slightly above where you are. Now, it's it has the password variable set by it does escape shell are around the past password. So am I like am I missing something because is that just not sufficient? I'm guessing it like it's just not sufficient enough to prevent the\", \"start\": 1210.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" no it's efficient. It prevents it prevents command. Ejection prevents you from escaping. But like I said, it's the actual injection happens in service thought sh it doesn't happen where PHP is calling service that sh Okay. So so this Escape set as it's being passed into service that sh so like the command injection. So there's going to be like a, you know, she'll execute or something like that with this whole command not sure if they show yeah, I don't think they show what that line looks like but there's going to be a shell like skill\", \"start\": 1237.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" with yeah, they leave some lines out which is why I think I got a little bit confused.\", \"start\": 1275.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, which is fair. But so they do she'll xq with it. They have command. I'll check in the login and password. It's then the service thought sh file uses that password again and inject said into the call to python. To run that python code. So it's where service that sh does if that it doesn't do any escaping there. It just uses it directly. So that's why they're able to escape.\", \"start\": 1278.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Okay. So overall I mean is it's a command injection. So it's not a super like technical issue but getting back into like the disclosure stuff. It seems there was a Reddit post from the person who was actually behind the disclosure and they said they tried for three weeks to get a response over email. I think they tried to different emails. They tried support and sales, I think They tried reaching out through Twitter and they got like basically it seems radio silence for like 3 weeks. It was just like they just decided to disclose it. Which do you think that's fair zi. Do you think they should have waited a little bit longer three weeks does seem a little bit short when you're talking about trying to disclose issues because sometimes vendors do take a little bit longer than that even well-known ones though.

I don't think is fair three weeks is short but three weeks of absolutely no feedback. It's probably your probably not hearing anything back. If you wait further weeks.

Then you disclose it here. You're not getting a response at all. So I think I think it's more reasonable to not wait a full 90 days. So yeah, I'm kind of an agreement. I think three weeks is a reasonable amount of time to expect some kind of response. So I was just kind of curious if you would have like a different point of view on on that. Did you want to add anything on there? I know I kind of cut you off earlier. So yeah, I think we'll move on to saltstack. So this is this is kind of one of our one of our more headlining topics. So this was published by f-secure labs and it details to vulnerabilities in saltstack. It's an authentication bypass and a directory traversal which we have a lot of in this episode. So salt stack is a digital infrastructure management product and it you know, it actually seems to Target security funnily enough and the The issue is there's a class called clear fungus which exposes these two methods sent Pub send Pub and prep off the info and it seems these methods are exposed to unauthenticated\", \"start\": 1514.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" requests. Yeah, so I just pulled up actually some of the code this is I believe I should have taken note. I believe this is a commit before they fix the issue that I've just kind of hold up in the basic idea here with clear funks is well, actually with this whole area of cone General is your able to send in your commands and it essentially because they also do this with just their a es encrypted commands and clear funks in particular the commands accessible without identification that are available in the clear. in the way they do this is Basically, you come in the you send the payload properly. It parses it. However that lock side and look into how it receives it. I just looked at how process these commands and it basically just ends up calling the function on itself notice this line\", \"start\": 1592.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" 1154.\", \"start\": 1650.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" We're just kind of grabs the sorry grabs the attribute of whatever the command is and calls it as a function.

Which\", \"start\": 1724.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is then the problem because they have a specter which just mentioned. There are the two commands the prep off fo and send pop both of those are single underscores before them. Which means somebody even though it's not necessarily documented can simply call either of those functions and use them. So I'll mention prep off info in particular basically just Returns the Ruki that's used to authenticate the commands so you can remotely call admin commands on like the master server using that key adjust returns that to you to use for whatever Joyce purpose you have. Send Pub on the other hand is basically to send messages out to. At their back to them. Well, I'm going to assume things go through the master regardless, but effectively it does the same thing. It results in code execution. Usually like it'll use send Pub an ill kind of craft the message in one of those functions else and then I'll just send it off there. But by calling it directly you can craft any sort of administrative message you want. What's kind of interesting here is this was used by lineage OS. I don't know. Did you have anything more to add about the vulnerability itself\", \"start\": 1728.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" specter? I know you've covered it pretty well there but I was actually going to say exactly what you're jumping into now is we've actually seen that this is being abused against like projects in the wild right now and you were saying like a lineage OS.\", \"start\": 1810.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah.

And then they had this further update now where they've updated they fixed and all that. Anyway. So lineage OS they use salt stack and on May 2nd, so just couple days ago an attacker used presume.

This was written obviously yesterday. So then yesterday to what Means that you had six days when you cuff preemptively stop this from happening. And I thought that was kind of an interesting point here. So obviously I don't want to you know, sit back and just you know victim blame essentially saying, oh, well, you know the companies always at fault or shouldn't be at fault or you know, that fact that I mean, it's still an illegal action.

But I mean, I feel like it's not necessarily being presented in good faith or without an ulterior motive I guess. But what I was just going to get at is in terms of I think like saltstack handle what they put out the discussed like notification pretty quickly. They put out a notification on GitHub with a PDF with a link that you couldn't actually click the link on which was really annoying. It's like, you know for more information. Here's the URL and you can actually click the URL. It was like they had a Word document or like a I don't know. I don't know what they will have had and then like printed it. Like maybe even had a PDF and then printed the PDF to PDF again. So it kind of flattened it. Hmm. Oh, so that was a little bit annoying on their side by apparently, they did emails and all that. So the fact that they're GitHub message wasn't perfect. I'm not really blaming them for but they put out the alert of really early pretty much as soon as they could. And then got a patch out as soon as they could after that. It's basically giving people the immediate. Do you know what to do and then try to fix it later? So lineage OS I should have responded to\", \"start\": 2200.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, I think that's fair. I will say there is a second issue that I'm going to jump back to and it was in the get token method which you can access from the same class. This one is like a more trivial issue. It basically takes a file name, but it doesn't validate against directory traversal. So you can just read files outside of the directory. Now that file does have to be able to deserialize with their salt that payload on cereal that loads method. So there is a kind of a condition attached to abusing that one, but I just wanted to mention that there was that other Issued attached to it now because of the impact even though these laws have been abuse as we just saw with lineage OS they didn't provide any pocs or anything like that. They wanted to kind of make it. So it's harder to exploit by Script kiddies and stuff like that. No, I'm jumping into the timeline. Sorry.

And actually I do want to jump back just speaking about the commit and the diff where they fix that. I'm not going to bother bringing it up on train, but I will mention that with the code. I showed earlier it was basically whatever command came in if it was a function on the class and it didn't start with the two underscores. It would try and execute that function.

I've got it listed as 1 so that explains convert different numbers, but unauthenticated second-order SQL injection. the SQL injection itself isn't terribly interests they have the code for this one basically they've got first SQL string here and then the results of that which is effectively what what courses you're in your that's the gist of it the results of that the columns from there are just imploded into the next query as is so if you could control with one of those values is our what the value contains then you can do a sequel injection because it doesn't do so into prepared\", \"start\": 2898.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" manner Which is funny because the first one is done a prepared manner, but the second one isn't that's kind of weird that like generally when you use well statements you try to use them\", \"start\": 2966.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" everywhere. It's not as weird though, because this is a variable amount of inputs which makes it a little bit more challenging to do a prepared statement.

Or whatever the variable mouth are. So the one this is one of those places where I absolutely see or have seen people not use prepared because it's not like just popping in a single value or just put the percent ass and put the value in later. This is An array of variable size now. I'm not saying it's a good practice to do that by any means it just that it's it's actually kind of comment to do that with some of these sorts of trusted data sets\", \"start\": 3004.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" also.\", \"start\": 3061.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So I guess going on from there though.

So what they found was in the IPS, that's your instant payment notification. So that's like, you know PayPal when you get a payment or whatever it'll hit that in point it will sign it. I'll do all that all that magic. What ends up happening is? It will take anything out of that every transaction.

So, you know it we're getting it to yet another directory traversal issue. Basically what happens here is they have an endpoint called uploads free writer, which is used for. Copying files when issues are moved from one project to another but the file name isn't validated and restricted. So if you create an issue with a link to a file name and move the issue, you can specify any file and that link and have the file copied to the second project. So, of course the example they give their is the dot dot slash dot dot slash, you know, escaping back and doing Etsy password. That's like the are D facto standard. Yeah, it's a good show. Thank you for mentioning that um, so not only did he get a 20K Bounty pay out of this which is pretty crazy. That's pretty high for anything you get through hacker one, but also, I don't know if you scroll down and saw some of the comments but it seems he also reported to other issues and get lab and managed to get an ultimate license which so I didn't know they did this get lab has like this kind of added incentive on their program where if you report three separate issues within like a certain time period you can get a An ultimate license for for get lab.

The gold is a hundred dollars per user per month and the license they give his per year. So it's probably about $1,200 worth of Licensing that you get for free there.

They do some reprocessing on the image. So anything that you want to do like an xss through has to survive all those Transformations, so because of that the vrp team actually initially rejected the issue saying it's not possible and they wouldn't accept it without a POC. It's kind of like, you know that POC or Get out, you know what I mean POC or GTFO. So this kind of turned it into more of a challenge like we have this common theme, I think over the entire episode where we have like trivial issues that take work to exploit because of just weird circumstances and just this is another one of those and this post goes through some of the techniques.

So, of course that's strict tried having stuff concatenated at the end of the image payload are I don't think one of these yeah, so they can only use jpeg so they couldn't use this using actually the pixel information to basically set your pixels just right so that it has the code you want. But what they did do was the payload in the jpegs entropy coded segment. Which is basically your like raw Huffman like the bitch rate the Huffman bitch tree. Having the code in there, but they still. They still need to have a way for it to survive something the Transformations being performed. So they've got the data in there. So they played around there.

exploits because there's just so much weirdness going on because of like what you were saying earlier where you had that kind of make it work synchronously where it's don't doesn't typically work that

it's almost always exploitable like I don't think like this is almost certainly could be used for code execution even though obviously the reproduction case doesn't do that though if you to challenge this is probably quite challenging and I would say get it get some experience with browser exploitation before tackling this one but you know if you are experienced with browser exploitation and kind

entitlement O'Day and what made this really interesting was usually when you see anything with iOS it's very complex and requires a lot of knowledge of the subsystems that work in iOS but this one is kind of an option 2 that you know general rule there is a bit of back there is background on entitlements which I'll talk about in a minute but it's not deeply technical you can understand the issue

And as imply the bug does seem to be pretty straightforward and it's basically in how entitlements are parse for I us so on Modern systems for sandboxing you'll have privilege boundaries right you're going to have the very common restriction based on uid you can't access resources of another uid or you need root or uid 0 to perform certain actions but iOS and Mac OS also use something called entitlements which are basically embedded into the app signature and these basically specify what an app can and can't do it's like a white list for what subsystems the app has access\", \"start\": 6800.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to yeah and I will say that this this also I believe it gets signed by Apple it does yeah so that's another challenge here like you can't just add\", \"start\": 6839.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" some random security or lack of security\", \"start\": 6848.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so in this case you could see the calm down Apple doll private security don't know container generally speaking I'm going to assume you can just ask for that normally I don't actually know if you can you\", \"start\": 6850.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" boss of the enrollments are signed by Apple like you're saying so that you know apps don't try to give themselves over reaching entitlements but that's only true in the case of like when it's sent to the App Store you can have developers certificates where the signature is actually managed by the developer and the signatures or the entitlement itself isn't actually signed but the provisioning profile is signed so basically there's a bit of a discrepancy there so that's going to the App Store you can't control that entitlement but with the development the Purser you can control the entitlement but it's restricted by the provisioning profile so it's a little bit weird there and basically the provisioning profile tries to whitelist one entitlements are okay for the developer certs to have but the problem is is the provisioning profile uses a different parser for parsing XML than the actual entitlement parsing does so Apple supports these things called P lists and XML or property lists and these basically allow you to use various different containers like dictionaries values stuff like that and what super weird is iOS has four different plist parsers and in the case of valid XML they all return the same thing but in the case of in valid XML there's discrepancies between the data that they return so as you can see in the POC if you're watching the stream he uses these tokens which are not valid token C uses like left angle bracket exclamation mark - - - right angle bracket and that's typically a comment but there's no actual comment in there it's just one you know well I started there's actually Merchant one\", \"start\": 6865.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's not quite even a valid comment which is kind of what I found interest here so I suspect was just mentioning its angle bracket the opening curly bracket exclamation point three dashes closing angle brackets interesting with that is when you do the open comment it needs two of those dashes and then when do the clothes it's two dashes so there's that overlap of that one character the middle that's part of both the open and the close and I believe that's where the parser differential comes in here between their three Parcels that they\", \"start\": 6968.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" use because\", \"start\": 7003.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you can kind of imagine if somebody were to write the code say looking for the first index of you know as their parsing through look for the first index of that angle bracket exclamation - - so the open comment they get the start of that and then from that star position they look for the next occurrence of just the - - like the closing comment and you can kind of understand if they don't increment it so doesn't include the dashes from the open if they don't start looking after that open tag if they actually include those then you can kind of understand where this parser differential comes from where the 1 parser see is that as also ending the comment whereas the others don't which is kind of the issue that happens here they do that and then they do another one that just has the open take no overlap like just two dashes in it that way it'll see a close one also on the other systems but not in the eye okay that they'll like you keep going\", \"start\": 7005.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah so essentially like the validator uses the core Foundation property list parser and then the actual use of the entitlement uses the I/O kit 1 so the core Foundation considers the exclamation point three dashes as the start and end comment where I/O kit just considers it the start of a comment so by using this you can basically make it so I owe kitces parts of the data that core Foundation can't see so you can kind of sneak entitlements past the it's verifying which is called the Apple mobile file Integrity AMF ID so there's a really nice little snippet that shows exactly what's going on here and I'm just going to bring it up on the screen so you can see they have a code snippet CFCs these bits ioq it sees these bits so you can see that the first bit you know our the second bit is basically not seen by the validator so it doesn't know that that entitlement is there and you can basically pass arbitrary entitlements to yourself and using that you have a Sandbox Escape oh and it's worth noting that these entitlements there's over like a thousand of them in apple and iOS and Mac OS there is actually like a list that somebody has been compiling that you could take a look at if you're curious but there's like so many entitlements that what you can do here is almost endless in a way just because there's so many different entitlements though it's very difficult to manage which is why I like you know especially when you're using different plist parsers it's just kind of impossible not to have issues here I do find it interesting why they use so many different ones why not just use one it's kind of weird they would use for different ones in different parts of the operating system but you know that's just probably know\", \"start\": 7069.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" processing things in

seguso was just playing around with app Dev trying to you know see what he could do with xcode and stuff and just kind of stumbled on the issue by accident and I wonder if that's kind of what tipped Apple off to fix it now it's you know you're always kind of had that thought process in your head like especially when it's such a subtle design issue what prompted it you know obviously we can't know

technical level but like a use after free or anything like that there's not really any like noise or instability this is just a it's a very simple parsing discrepancy bug which if you hit it right will have a 100% success rate it's a very clean bug which is extremely rare in iOS so this was kind of like a you know like a gold a gold nugget kind of in the in the Iowa seen so it definitely blew

reddits p.m. me or shellcode I just like getting shellcode and I like taking a look at so it's always been having mine but I know other people that yeah at least take a cursory look at the Shell Code to see what it's doing oh and I feel like this code says said it's it's effectively simulate is a honey pot in a proof of concept in a piece of proof of concept code so he put it out there are actually several copies of it for several different CVS as though you can run this script you know give it the arguments and it'll compromise whatever Target you give it obviously using whatever the seavey's about what it actually does is it connects to his own server and all the commands you run just hit his own server give you some fake response back and that's that so it's a honey pot but it's at the exploit level the Cody use though I will say just put it up on stream it's really obvious that something suspicious is going on here because you'll notice that the end socket dot socket and does nothing with the socket except try and create a creates a raw socket does it so like it never even uses the local IP or the port but it does do an exact Shell Code which is you know python execute and side a python so like it's office skated it's using hex so for those of you just listening effectively all the script does is like prints nth and I just noticed this is python 2 because that's you know print without wrapping brackets but um print sending payload that it has like shellcode with a bunch of hacks like kind of looks like shellcode the lines are a little bit long in my opinion along Shell Code would be shorter lines but she'll go and just depending packs to it and then in theory you would then send that out so like if I was looking at this and like I said I do generally because it is a concern I would mostly just be looking for you know just a straight-up call to like system or like a p open or something like clear command injection I might not immediately get that the shellcode was that but that exact they're like eight super suspicious like I think he could have done a better job at making it look okay like even if somewhere in there he is like the target pour Faire like the target IP and stuff Santa's little things but that said even though I'm saying that he had like twenty five hundred runs effect so even though I'm saying like I definitely

had to do for hitting this bug had to be done on a real Nintendo 64 so in the post he kind of goes through the reversing that he had to do to try to pull feedback from the console and he found that the game had debugging statements left in it and stuff like that so it goes through the whole process of what he did to debug that exploit and how we found the actual issue which is a stack Overflow
