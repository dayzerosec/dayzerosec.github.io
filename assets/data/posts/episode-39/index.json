Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me is zi. So we're just going to jump right into some news. So we have something if you are one of those to cover first and it's something we actually missed a few weeks ago on April 17th realized desktop 3 was released and the big thing that dropped with that was that they actually change the licensing though that the non-commercial use license or the personal license were realized was made free where it wasn't before so we now have Another decompiler out there, that's not $10,000. So that is a pretty big point that we ended up missing especially because we covered Benja last week and we didn't really cover realize much and that's just something we missed somehow. So we definitely wanted to remedy that and\", \"start\": 9.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, I think we kind of missed it. I don't know about you. I saw people talking about realized a little bit like saw some chatter, but I'd remembered realized as like I said, I think we've mentioned we have mentioned it before I think we've looked at it not On stream before but just in general and well didn't like it didn't as far as I know didn't have a decompiler that point either either. Yeah, I don't think it did. So when I saw it, I didn't even know they are planning a decompiler. So I saw people talk about the updates like okay, it's just another update and we don't generally tend to just cover, you know, just standard updates. So I didn't even really look into it. So it was until somebody pointed out know there's a decompiler with it that We actually started looking at it and I think talking before stream. You mentioned that you don't really take too much of a look. At the decompiler yet or have you\", \"start\": 54.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I haven't really looked at realize I am going to be doing a strain that's going to be looking at it probably tomorrow, but some at some point throughout this week. I'm not setting tomorrow like Hart and stone, but I would like to really like do kind of like what we did with Benja on a stream do that with realize. You know, I think for those of you who is there to shake so for\", \"start\": 109.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" those of you who didn't catch that also we did do a like for our stream looking at the binge of decompiler. We had want the Ciphertext come in answered some questions. Tell us a little bit about the future like there's a lot of good information in that stream.\", \"start\": 129.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. I think he joined it about 90 minutes in for anybody wants a timestamp for that.\", \"start\": 143.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" But yeah, so coming on to realize I did take a look at some things mostly things that we noticed Benja did or didn't do so the obvious one was with Binger. We noticed that a lot of are not a lot of but I'll in that bad characters from Rob Emporium. I wasn't doing that. Initialization so I know it's real eyes does have that in there it gets that cracked unsigned local characters gets the type right there. I did find a little bit weird that this fourth line a created it as an array sized one. And yeah did the office like I don't quite get why did it for that one like that?\", \"start\": 149.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But many others.\", \"start\": 188.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. And I mean, obviously you tell it the type you tell it's an array it rewrites everything just fine. A few other things I noticed in general. It didn't do for Loops. It would always prefer to Sting the while loop and just having the anti. Yeah similar to what Ghidorah would do which I mean the for Loop is what it was written as prop. Well actually, okay. So in another example that I decompiled, oh is definitely for loop, I would assume this is a for loop from Rob important given what it's doing but I don't technically know that the other thing I noticed here is On line 27 you have the access by index like the array type access but then when its accessing the other array, it just did a pointer calculation added the aqua technically it added the pointer to the offset. So it did that actually most of the time it did intend to create that array index. I just this is another one of those cases where I don't see why saw this one is an array and then wouldn't treat the other one as an\", \"start\": 189.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" array. Yeah, there must be a very subtle discrepancy in the instructions that like it just\", \"start\": 259.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" interpreted. Well, I tried looking at that and I couldn't nothing really stood out to me as to why I would do that and you know been Joe would treat this just as the pointer arithmetic it wouldn't even do the array index. So technically I mean realize doing a little bit better on that. So those are kind of a couple things. I know she's just looking at this bad characters loop again. We just need to find the other screenshot I have. I want the other things here. So this was I would have just like a little dummy program that I wrote and we had mentioned on ninja kind of the Annoying size conversions in line 12 on this rotates ring. You see like the cast unsigned and cash\", \"start\": 266.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" character pointer\", \"start\": 313.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and owned. It still seemed a little bit excessive in this case to not as bad or at least definitely a lot more readable than binary ninjas was but still a little bit excessive compared to what probably could be done. Unfortunately. I didn't have G drill went to do comparisons back and forth on this one. I just kind of took what I remembered from Benja. And just apply that on to looking at the realize one here. It did create this variable size and that that's in the in the assembly itself course it it pulls that out as kind of its own little own little thinks. That's fair. Gives a you know, kind of that nice readable name so I gained kind of a fair move there. Once\", \"start\": 316.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I will say in general like the samples you've been pulling up. I do find the syntax to be a little bit more readable than binges and I think that might be because it's closer to C code. Yeah, and that's like I kind of prefer that style. You know what I mean? I like it.\", \"start\": 366.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I high-level my speaking of compilable. Here's my grape can copy and paste code. I could not find any way to extract this piece. That's why these are all screenshots with Bender. I copied the code. I will put it into my editor. So I had like it's highlighting. Yes, as far as I can tell and I'm sure somebody's going to correct me on this and I hope somebody does but I could not find a way to copy just a line of code out or the whole thing. I could have like save as Oh,\", \"start\": 382.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that's like a glaring missing\", \"start\": 418.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" functionality. It does like nothing. I tried. So on Binger a few if you happen to click on what the key words, it would kind of highlight the line and then sub highlight the key word that he clicked on. If you tried to copy it would just copy the keyword with realized so sorry back on binges. But if you happen to just click the line make sure there are no other highlights are did copy like it would copy the whole line you can drag through. And copy everything with this you could copy keywords out, but you couldn't like drag over to copy multiple keywords. You couldn't just select the whole line. It would copy nothing in that case. So that's actually kind of an issue here. But I do feel like that's more of an oversight or like a bug not an intended feature. Although on that note. I will say and this is something I felt when I first he's realized like it's a really polished UI but I dislike it. I just I wouldn't want to use it. I don't like its UI. But it is fairly polished. I'm not sure exactly what it is. It just it's not it's not my workflow and he can change it kind of how I would normally work. I guess just how would she know some of the tabs? There are some customizations. It's just, you know, definitely kind of a personal preference thing to say. I don't really like it but that is a very personal thing. Like I'm not going to say nobody should use this because I don't like it. I mean obviously they've created something somebody's using yet somebody's paying for it. It's Y'all just personally I didn't really like the UI but it is very polished like it's a nice Cy. but\", \"start\": 419.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" we got something I'll ask for when you were investigating. Do they have an API for scripting and stuff like that?\", \"start\": 525.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" You know, I did not look into it. Like I was purely just looking at what? The decompiler was doing okay because last\", \"start\": 534.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" time I remember with realized they didn't have scripting support and that is something that is a something that a lot of people like for reversing. Right? They'll write their own plugins to\", \"start\": 543.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" looks like they do or they have some plugins. At least now, I just pulled it up on Google\", \"start\": 554.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" here that could be interesting to look at to because that is like that is one thing binary Ninja really has going for it is it's a pi. So I'd want to see how that kind of Compares with realize that\", \"start\": 559.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" That's\", \"start\": 570.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fair on thing to check out one thing. I do notice just with your screen shot though. This is like a minor gripe, you know, it's nothing big at if you know the data types, you can probably follow along but what I found interesting is with the parameters it'll actually denote in 64 for like the return types in the parameters. But then for the local variables in the function, they don't use those explicit types. They use like intend long and those can be a little bit. Using because when you start talking about long in Windows and Linux, they mean different things in Windows along is 32 bits and Linux along a 64 bits. So I would prefer if they had some of those more explicit types. So instead of unsigned long size. They had you and 64 size or or keep it consistent underscore underscore in 64 sighs.\", \"start\": 570.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's something that I think Binger gets pretty well is listen. Yeah, just as a general not necessarily. Back to Gap or just generally when they do the code. It's they're very explicit with everything which kind of ends up be making a little bit verbose a little bit unreadable at times but they are very explicit with what's happening.\", \"start\": 621.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It can be at times but on other times, you know, if you're looking for bugs you having access to that size right there and not having to think about it. It can be a\", \"start\": 643.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" oh, yeah, I think it's definitely it's a good thing for Benja to do that. Like I do it's also like their annotations and stuff. off With those annotations, what ends up happening is you have as you're saying like a lot of information just available at your fingertips. That's why I keep going to mentioning it the like signed and unsigned comparisons. It's such a small thing that I didn't notice. I was missing until I saw them actually have that. Yeah,\", \"start\": 653.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" here's a bit of a fun question. Not one that's really related to decompiling or anything like that. Would you like it if that was actually like a language feature if you had to specify if it was an unsigned or son to compare because I know like currently it's basically to do this by the types unsigned has a higher precedence than sign. So if you have an unsigned argument in the in the like comparison, it's going to be an unsigned compare, but you don't really know that when you're looking at Code you've got to know what happens at the compiler level to know if it's a signed or unsigned to compare or you have to like look through the types. And sometimes you have type definitions and you have to go up like, you know, a bunch of lines to see what the original type was the would you like if like in development you had to specify what kind of comparison you wanted second\", \"start\": 683.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" question and no I would have liked it but as an optional feature\", \"start\": 731.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It could be a cool idea anything like if it would show you, you know, you hover over the conditional Titan showing it.\", \"start\": 740.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Like I think it's definitely useful and doing the re writing the code because the way that would mostly be used as just a force one way or the other. Yeah. I know it feels like that.\", \"start\": 746.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Adding a little web much for the programmers.\", \"start\": 758.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I can understand though if you want to do that as a as an optional\", \"start\": 761.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" feature Yeah, and that actually brings up something not related to languages. But with the decompiler that I think would be cool here is what you were saying earlier with like the explicitness sometimes being able or leading to like unreadable code what I think would be a really good solution here was if you had an option to show explicit types if you just right click and go, okay, so explicit types or you could use the unsigned enter longer whatever if you wanted the more readable version and you could just switch When you want it to see\", \"start\": 767.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know what? I mean? That's fair. I don't think using like N64 really wouldn't make it unreadable though. I don't think that That's really an unreadable thing. I think with binge I when it does all the size changes, that's where it becomes unreadable. That's where it becomes a little bit provokes\", \"start\": 799.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, but I don't think just\", \"start\": 818.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" using in 64 is an unreadable thing.\", \"start\": 820.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" No, but I just think in general with like not just realize with binary ninjas. Well, there are some things that some people really like and other people don't like and they say it causes unreadable code and a lot of that just comes down to just allow people to specify if they Or\", \"start\": 824.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not, you know, yeah, I think that could be a\", \"start\": 838.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fair feature. Yeah, I think that would be a really Really cool addition in both but yeah, so like jumping back to that not being able to copy code. Hopefully like you said that's just an oversight. Even if there is a way to do it that it should be a lot more intuitive than that. Like the fact that you had to struggle to do. It is a problem in itself. Even if it is possible through some weird obscure UI thing. So that's something that needs to be worked on one thing one other thing. I did want to ask with realized since you were talking about Like the UI and stuff does it allow theming support?\", \"start\": 840.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So this is a theme in particular. I'm not sure if you can do customized themes but they do have some built-in ones. So I immediately switch to this dark solarize theme\", \"start\": 878.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" because I know the default is that right? You know? Yeah light theme and I yeah, and I think that should\", \"start\": 887.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not not even just like a hughes's white like like it's not just the right thing it is. So yeah, that was one of the first things I look for and I changed it. So this is kind of I like the theme that I had settled on they only had like three. I feel like they probably do allow custom theming I just and look into that. That's it. I do have a couple other comparisons to bring off one of the things I noticed a lot and this is looking at Ready Player one kind of won four challenges on zero X zero, five three nine dotnet. Is you'll notice in this example and the decompiler it does create thread has a return value and then assign the data 0 x 6 5 5 4 bit basically taking the return value and then tossing it into the actual memory location where it ends up being stored. Which I mean is fair, but what binary ninja does there's it'll compress that into just a single line, which is much more readable granted binary ninja has like, you know that Das header which we already talked about soffits constants are a little bit\", \"start\": 893.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" forced. Yeah, which they're working on\", \"start\": 960.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but in terms of how it does that code I far prefer this just saying it's putting it into the memory address and one line rather than not compressing that and in general dereferences what and get I guess compressed like that with realize so just generally result in longer code.\", \"start\": 963.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Now one thing I do notice between the two of them is you notice how in the realize on the create thread it does the address of operator on those data variables War but in binary ninja it doesn't do that. I think that might be something I would like and binary ninja because it's more explicit and it tells you it's taking the address it's not just directly and that's referencing that. So I think that that might be something that binary ninja is a bit lacking in that screenshot. Yeah. It's\", \"start\": 983.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" a\", \"start\": 1013.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That might just be on the preference, but I would like the aggressive operator Reserve.\", \"start\": 1013.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I apologize for the audio right now for whoever's listening to us. Not sure what the source of that was but But I apologize for that seems so soft. I'm not sure if you were able to hear that Specter. Yeah. Yeah, I heard it.\", \"start\": 1020.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Okay. Yeah not if you're sure came from I haven't heard that before coming. Neither have I I've I've actually heard that before but it's usually one like I dropped packets from the server not like and I just checked and I didn't drop any so,\", \"start\": 1038.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" okay. So I believe it might have been an interaction with my phone and maybe a quarter or something because I moved my phone and I went away anyway coming back one of the last things I do want to point. Out with realized is also when it's doing so in terms of the loops. I found it would also sometimes do it would just miss the conditional completely for the loop. If you notice in this one. It's got the breakdown at the bottom. Rather than so. It's basically that the break can continue their well, it checks a v like this was a for loop again, actually. Yeah, so it just kind of pushes all that to the bomb and I saw a few place where I would do like while one and then some condition towards the end. so Oh, no, I mean it just it ruins kind of flow of reading it rather than having the condition, of course in the loop\", \"start\": 1050.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" itself. I mean, yeah, it's also technically wrong because it that basically tells you that all that code runs before the condition is checked for is in a for Loop most likely the condition is being checked before the code is being rent.

Now this is this does say in 2019 and into the future so they have some like statistics and stuff in there. But I think the biggest change that they're doing here is they're no longer running a first reporter winds policy. There are now going to be splitting Downey's between all duplicates Within. 72 hours hours. Yeah, which honestly I don't know if I like that but they do do parade of the mounts for higher quality reports as well. They're also going to be raising payouts for higher impact bugs. Sandbox. Escape is going to be 8 to 10 K proxy bypass is going to be three to five k and they've also started a Blog called the the attack and defense blog which might be of interest to like viewers of our stuff like that now I did Kind of want to point out like that first reporter wins versus the you know, Bobby's being split part.

Just don't get it there for you. Just don't fuzz. Oh, I feel like 72 hours is a sufficiently short amount of time to prevent a lot of guy duplicates from something leaking or whatever. It's 72 hours.

It's unreasonable to expect the vendor to pay. Like, you know a standard payout for all duplicate reports, especially if it's some like trash bug that gets found by everyone fussing it, you know what I mean? But this one is kind of sucks too. Because if it is a trash bag that a lot of people fuzz for then okay before you would have had one person that got a payout and the rest of the people didn't get anything right in this case you could end up with a lot of people reporting it and everyone getting like next to nothing now though.\", \"start\": 1461.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" They do mention your high quality report to do still gaining you that like the Plus on it.

If it isn't being split off that also touches on cat 3009 out of chat to mentions, you know, there's some time you spend to you sir. I'll just read you know after you On the back there's some time what you spent analyze that you could spend two days just create a high quality report on the other hand. Someone else can just submit a crash. So Mozilla does trying task that a little bit with this and being one you can update here report after you submit so you submit the trash and then you keep updating it because the payouts being based on kind of the follow-up discussion not on the initial report. So they're trying to tackle that issue. They are splitting. Yes, but if you have a higher quality report, you do still end up with a higher payout. Maybe not as much. But I mean at least they're trying to do something and I think it's fair for them to be trying to do something about this issue because duplicates is one in my life and want the biggest grapes. I hear from people about doing bug bounties is you know, something's just marked as a dual.

We'll move on to one of the bigger stories of the week, which was the source code for csgo and TF2 being leaked from 2017 and 2018. So there was a lot of misinformation going around around this this news. There was a lot of people I saw people saying I never going to launch csgo again. I'm just going to get exploited as soon as I get into a game and that's just that's just ridiculous. Alice just because the source code is out doesn't mean going to be exploited the moment you join a Lobby that's just absurd. I think a lot of information was spread from people who aren't familiar with with development or security or anything like that and they\", \"start\": 1820.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" just have so there's actually one thing in this chain that I want to find a readout, you know, title their major security risk. This is not a chain message that sound, you know, there's been a huge Source leaked. And effectively they mention here all games running Source are now super vulnerable against the various purposes. And if you play TF2 csgo or any other source game, you're taking a major security risk. We advise all our players to take a break from these games until further updates come out. And for those reasons we're also shutting down our servers later tonight. So it's not like valve knows all of it has valve, right? Yeah. Okay. It's not like valve knows all of the exploits that are in their past code that they haven't yet patched and then you know, these future updates are going magically patch all of them. So just on that little bit where it's saying until further updates come out. It's like, you know any issues that are found here that are going to take a While to be found to use notice and then actually patch so it's not like oh, yeah next update you're going to be good to go that said is you're consenting just because the sources out there. This is several several years old. Well as that one's 30 2018. Yeah. So sir couple years old, then there are few years, whatever. It's not ancient. But it's not these are games that are also update fairly frequently. So there's going to be a lot of turnover.\", \"start\": 1862.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I do actually have a Counterpoint to that. I think the networking stack from people I've heard of the or like people I know that deal with Source engine and stuff at least the networking stack. I don't think they really touch that much.

It\", \"start\": 1960.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" was just going to get into that you there's going to be a lot of turnover in some areas, but not everywhere. There are going to be some areas that Don't get much out of it. As you said the network stack being one of those. I'm sure there are some core engine areas of probably don't get touched super often either.

Go ahead.\", \"start\": 1974.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, I'm just going to say it'll be easier to find bugs maybe because you have the source code, you know. Like source code auditing is easier than binary auditing typically.\", \"start\": 2005.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. It's just there's going to be that signal to noise ratio. There's going to be a lot of noise because the game like this isn't the current Source.\", \"start\": 2015.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, and the other problem is exploiting sorts engine is actually a lot more difficult than people think and the reason for that is There's one thing that's very hard to do for any rce for anything and that's going to be info leaked to abuse an ASL art environment. You are going to need to bypass address space layout randomization and you're going to need an info lead to do that. And that's very difficult to accomplish within rce. You can find buffer overflows and Source engine fairly easily from what I know. It's not hard to find, you know bugs that lead to memory corruption. The harder part is being able to actually We leverage them because they're in components that are just they're hard to info league in and that's that's basically all there is to it. So even if you find a bug that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be easy to exploit. It could take you months to be able to try to exploit that bug so, you know just adding on to that point that just because the source code is out doesn't mean there's suddenly going to be exploits flying around for csgo and TF2.\", \"start\": 2023.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I mean again though like no doubt it helps, but you're not suddenly every Care either any of the bugs that are found have been in there for at least a couple years. So you've been a terrorist for the last couple years all so it's just a little bit easier. Now, I will say that does he'll probably in the sense of just being able to understand the overall architecture of things to getting that big picture from what it used to look like that in the background knowledge. Yeah, like it's definitely useful for people looking for\", \"start\": 2088.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" issues. Now here's one thing that a lot of people that you know reacted to this didn't even really consider. This isn't the first time that source code is slate. Source engine is leak before I ate soooo pretty old now. I think it's maybe 2007-2008. So it is pretty dated but the source code is leaked before and There hasn't really been an RC e exploit campaign that I'm aware of that is targeted csgo or TF2 there have been exploits that have been used but they're mostly like Dawson's games, you know, crashing games on people. They're not, you know deploying malware or something like\", \"start\": 2120.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that. Yeah. I mean, I actually when we talked about the csgo days, I'm like episode like two or three or something like really early. Yeah\", \"start\": 2166.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" upon it. I don't even think it really affect the csgo. Yeah, it's 1.6.\", \"start\": 2176.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think there was like a minor wait impacted CS csgo. But I mean that's kind of the other thing. I think a lot of the people looking at source engine or looking at it for the Bounty valve has a decent bounty on it and there\", \"start\": 2179.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" were probably one of the better ones on hacker one.\", \"start\": 2193.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So I mean, I think a lot of people are looking at for that enough for malicious purposes. I mean, obviously there are malicious things it could be done. But I mean if if you're targeting somebody it's probably not through csgo like I don't know if feels like csgo is a really the normal route. That would be targeted.\", \"start\": 2196.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That's not an ideal Vector. Like it's just too much work\", \"start\": 2220.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and the denial of service though is you mentioned that like that's something I could definitely see, you know, script kiddies trying to find issues for to you know, daus other players or whatever, but see part of the problem though is a\", \"start\": 2224.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" lot of the bugs found in csgo and stuff like that are in the map parsing Engine with witches for like custom maps. So people playing on official servers. Is the bugs not going to affect them anyway, so it's one of those things where it also the attack surface is kind of limited and what you're going to look for on official servers. So that's another thing to consider their there's something else I wanted to say. Oh, yeah, so overall I think Four players for csgo players TF2 players this this basically doesn't really mean much to them. I mean cool, you know that it's leaked if you want to check that out. Maybe you can I haven't really gone looking for the league because I'm not really that interested. Maybe it's something you want to know if you're a player and take into consideration. I'm not going to tell people whether to play or not to play, you know, I don't think I should be doing that. But what I will say is I think overall the only person is really hurts is valve. It's a bit embarrassing for them. Now. This this wasn't like somebody hacked into the you know valve and then stole the source code. This was a leak from a Dev who had access to the repo. It was a disgruntled employee that was like laid off or something like that and put it out there though, but you know, it could be I think there were some chat logs and stuff that relate to so it's mostly just a bit of an embarrassment for valve. I don't think in her players and stuff like that or the public at large this even really needs to be considered. I think it was blown bar out of proportion compared to what is actually\", \"start\": 2236.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah. I definitely agree. I think was blown out of proportion. I mean, it's it's useful but here not like at imminent risk because of it.\", \"start\": 2329.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, exactly. So we'll move into our into our last news topic before doing some exploits and that's fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities and malicious code execution in XG firewall, so, There was a report received on April 22nd about a suspicious field being exposed in the management interface for the XG firewall and they did some this is so\", \"start\": 2337.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Folks by the way Friend by listening.\", \"start\": 2363.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, and you know after they did some investigation and they found it was an attack on fire wall units.

They got hash passwords. They fixed it and sent out an alert to everyone who was affected which I do have like a question on one of their alerts, but I'll get to that in a minute. We I don't think I couldn't really see any information like technical information on exactly why yes, Carol.

It's one thing you've kind of said over the past in our episode zi is like you care more about how they respond to an attack rather than the fact that the attack happened and I think how they responded here was overall positive, you know, they have the full timeline. They let people know they sent out the email sent out the alerts. They started the investigation as soon as they notice. This is the suspicious field.

Well, I kind of think about it like this when you go on a shell and you want execute, you know a particular file, let's say that's in you know C program files like well if you LS isn't good example because that's rarely going to be somewhere that has a space but like every word so the first word it's going to treat as the command in Windows you obviously have a lot of paths that The path has a space. So program files being the classic example. So if they just did that first word is just going a little can try and execute this C program and then there's a space. So the first word is the first argument. It's the Program you want to know? Well, that's not a program. So it'll pain the next thing next word on to I see if that makes proper path and so on and so on until you get it. So, of course if you just have like C program dot exe, it will execute that it'll execute that with high privileges.

Well the gist of this is really simple and some cases when using key base, you know sending messages with key base it all encode your message as Basics T4, or is Jason basic and then basic see for it.

That said they couldn't find a way to actually send this base64 encoded string. They only mentioned using the key base GUI CLI and the mobile client. My assumption is you're just going to have to do kind of like the like the rod Network layer to inject that thing not using the standard interface. So I imagine it's probably possible to just send it that said it may not be they do just mention that when they tried to send a user. Seeing any of the normal means it didn't work. Nonetheless, I mean it has such Jason so they had to find something where they could include that jacent that would get converted. That would be handled by something that would decode the basics for some suggest including a message. It wouldn't be which they looked around for it found in lumens, which apparently I'm not familiar with it integrates into the key based client lets you send this xlm coin through key race like her send payment request in chat.

That's all I'm suggesting act. Yeah, it's just I think that is like, you know, not as surprising as it would be for like some other products, for example. Yeah, we'll move on to a more impactful bug which is in jQuery. So it's a jQuery XS through the HTML function and it's in the HTML pre-filter method for jQuery. And that's notable because jQuery is obviously used by like everything. There's a lot of web apps that use jQuery the details on this page. I found a bit weird, but they do link out to a challenge page that has more complete information on what the actual bug is. So that's probably the better page for getting information if you want to look at it essentially, it seems the bug comes down to a discrepancy between how the sanitation treats HTML compared to enter HTML. Ml is a bit of a weird thing going on there when it comes to self-closing tags. So so is hex image for example is a good example of that\", \"start\": 3346.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if I can jump in quickly. It's all wood jQuery jQuery will do some extra work that inner HTML just wouldn't do so this particular bug if we actually look at the challenge, which I brought up on stream, but essentially it would take your user input. And it would sanitize it for like using Dom purify putting it right into the HTML that want you so in theory using dompierre Feist anti was like this should be solid it and dumped here if I sanitized is sanitizing it to be included in HTML. So if you took this HTML string tossed it into like, you know, whatever whatever div dot inner HTML inner HTML wouldn't do anything more it would take Just toss it right in and kind of crazy HTML tree, obviously the user inputs being purified so it should be okay. Winds up happening with HTML Specter was saying about this pre-filter with the pre-filter would do. And I'll pull up the solution area. Pre-filter would do is it would take those tags that Specter was just mentioning the self-closing takes that's where you have so they actually do a style as their example, which usually isn't a self-closing tag usually want some content in your style tape, but basically where you just have the opening angle bracket style / closing angle brackets kind of that one tag. So the classic example there BR would be one image is often written like that and what it would do is it would replace All self-closing tags or with a full tank. So the open and close tag. I'm not sure why exactly they do that why they don't just leave them like that said I've never really looked at the pre-filter to know what else they're doing. But with that what ends up happening here is when they do that if you also have a dangling, well, it's not dangling normally. So what they do is they do a style tag. Take a self-closing style tag and then a close style tag and after their self closing the action of some content there. What ends up happening is that replacement ends up being dropped in there with the open and closed style and that's Islands up closing. Sorry about that that's style ends up closing the original style tag and the content that was after it ends up being placed kind of after that being completely uncontained.\", \"start\": 3409.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, basically breaks out. So what you're able to do\", \"start\": 3572.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" with that is when it's completely uncontained off so you can start including actual HTML there because it's no longer contain like a would be anti for Style. So script alert and Away you go. Now the challenge itself also does little bit dumb clobbering that I don't think still important to cover here. We've talked about that in past episodes. It's an old attack. So I don't think we need to talk about that. The key thing here is in jQuery because that HTML pre-filter just replacing those self-closing tags.

The reason I mentioned that is it'll it the the repo just says security risks and when I read that I usually think like, you know info a sec security risks, but that's not what it actually is.

So what happens is you've got this Albatross endpoints animal IDP selections selecting, whatever your identity provider is and it takes a username and a session ID in from the URL parameters and without doing anything else really just checks, you know is the username know or have Value the session ID known or not having value gives you an are and those cases. Tries to grab the user based on that username or gives you an error if I can't find it and just a so CH the session ID with the user and then redirects them to what I assumed was the proper sam'l IDP selection page because it basically ends of redirecting you to the outside of the albatross at first first parameter in like the directory structure redirects you outside of that to the same page sam'l IDP selection. Some might guess is a something like some old code or like a use actually do something here. Then they decide to make another page actually do that like not every service had to implement this or something and they just left this code in there.

If it doesn't find it basically does the same thing though. It generates a new. Well, it grabs a uuid for the user and generates a new password for them in the one case.

Yeah, so we have yet another project zero posts related to chromium which you know is pretty cool because the project zero guys are really smart and they do some really cool write-ups and this one is about a one-line change that was made in Windows 10 1903 which could allow a Sandbox escape and code execution in the GPU process of chromium. So they gave some really nice. Background to chromium sandboxing on Windows and some of the stuff they do so, you know, they disabled groups. They remove Integrity levels and they advert stricted access tokens or security identifiers or what they call SIDS and that's mainly enforce a few steps. I think the big one like the last line of defense is the colonel restricts what tokens can be assigned to unprivileged users in a new process the sandbox also restricts the ability to get suitable access tokens and they do so much. Our stuff like child process mitigation and stuff like that. But the the colonel enforcing the restriction on access tokens is kind of the critical point of failure here if that's broken, you know, the other ones are easier to get around kind of thing. The the one is like the bottom brick basically of the wall. So I mean you can you can guess what subsystem the vulnerability was introduced in it was in the kernel enforcement of the access tokens. So the one-line change Change they made if we scroll down a\", \"start\": 4640.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" little so before you actually go with what the issue was. I do want to mention what's really important here. Is that basically when you create a new process so during the sandbox process and they talked a little bit about how their sandboxing works, but you have the access token A specter said they apply some restricted ssids to it. They end up restricting the actual process token itself. So what's to prevent your process from just being a new process that has a more permissive token and that's where this idea of child and sibling tokens come in when you create a token or sir when you create a process you should have its parent token should be like the process creating it then gets assigned as like being a child on the other hand though you could have a sibling token which has the same parent ID as The process creating it and no ID or an auth token is also included in there. So what ends up happening with this bug now is basically made it impossible to create the parent-child token. So would inherit all of those restrictions anymore out of the parent it would be treated as a sibling and that comes simply because rather than in the old case the code was new token the parent token ID field. Old would get the value of the oil token token ID. Basically, you know, the parents token gets tossed in as being the parent open ID exactly. What should be in this new with this one line change it took the old tokens parent token ID and set it as the parent Hogan ID of the new token. So that made it a sibling. It wasn't a child of the process that was creating it. It was a sibling to it which then meant that Basically, you could do everything that sibling could it was a sibling to any other desktop application rather than being a child in the sandbox?\", \"start\": 4728.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But you can set it to like a service to get like all the permissions at that service does to I think\", \"start\": 4855.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well service to be\", \"start\": 4860.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" use but I had thought I had it written down but I\", \"start\": 4861.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" don't yeah, so like the basic will be able to pass that check.

It's 0 click against the default mail application on iOS the bug has been around since at least iOS 6 it's 0 click when the mail application is opened in the background on iOS 13 on iOS 12. You do need to click the mail in order to trigger the attack and they don't include information about the earlier versions and how you might exploit it. Oh, the other thing was on 12 you do get 0 click if you control the mail server, which is a pretty high barrier when you're trying to attack. Somebody probably don't control their mail server. and okay wasn't showing up on my stream of so there are two ways. She's one of them was the one that was actually exploit. That's a remote Heap overflow. But the other one that they also discovered that was being attacked not necessarily. As use though both kind of come out of this MFM you are sorry MF mutable data type in the my library. So application type, you know, MF mutable data. I'm not familiar with it. But you can get an out of bounds right where? Factually, what would end up happening is as it would read data from the email. So if you send your email as as being that are having this mind type as a would read the data out. It would write to a file or write it to an M mapped. Location and so every time it would get a new chunk. It would call F truncate syscall that basically can be used spite the name being drunk Amy think make smaller. It would resize it in general. So with f trunk a it would get called and ideally you'd be adding extra memory onto the end of whatever the buffer was. So whatever size of the chunk add that memory with f truncate and then read and then write to it. What ended up happening though is if F trunk a failed it didn't care just kept going so you can kind of imagine what would happen. It doesn't actually extend the buffer. You keep writing out of bounds right plain and simple they don't talk about the actual exploitation. Mechanism. All they gave is kind of that little detail leading to the out of bounds, right? In a very similar way the MF mutable data the append data or a pain bites. function would also be used for Sorry, I'm getting two of the issues confused. So that's actually it was in the append data function where this one that I just talked about is where it kind of came from after okay would fail it would do the outer bounds, right? The remote Heap overflow was also in this MF mutable area of code in particular MFD a message content consumer. So again, this is downloading the email if you give it that mime type, it creates an NS mutable data, which calls a pen data on it. The NS mutable data has a threshold this time of 200,000 or hex teeth two hundred thousand bytes. So when you get larger than that writes it off to a file on and Maps into memory. What was interesting here rather than being the truncate that fails when it tried to get a large sure thing if you Sent an email that was large enough to exceed the ramp size or the remaining ramp. So basically large enough that it couldn't expand its size any further it would fail and when it would fail it would check for that failure. Actually the some DMF would fail it would check that and it would just do this block invoke which only would do an 8 byte allocation. so any data that you upended after that eight bytes are after larger than 8 bytes would be overwritten in the Heap so that's the exploit that was actually used or at least they were actually seeing me being exploited most often again they don't talk about the fool exploit just what the issues were that they saw\", \"start\": 5044.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yes oh that was the most interesting part in What made it blow up right was it the it was found that it was being attacked in the wild yeah it wasn't just like issues they found while they were auditing or something like that and now it's too bad we don't have an t on because I noticed they have a list of some like really interesting targets that were suspected to be hit by this so you got like Fortune 500 organization like an individual's from those VIP from Germany a journalist in Europe.

Is in particular has you're saying they're both the militias are compromised hypervisor trying to get information. So SMA is secure memory encryption that encrypts memory before it's being written to wrap. What SCV does is every VM should be getting its own SME key, so it should have its own encryption. And then also I cves or encrypted state will split kind of the VM State into two parts. So the VM State usually is unencrypted and contain sky like controller or the unencrypted control air contains information like flags that the VM my knee. It's information VM does need but also can contain like registered some information like that. It's the state effectively so though on Krypton they split it into two parts one just being the unencrypted stuff that the VM actually need to that stuff like that. I was mentioning and then that's a very that contains all the other information. A nation that gets encrypted stuff like that. Yeah that gets encrypted in a way that the hypervisor can't see it. or shouldn't be able to see it obviously though some operations do require the hypervisor to know things about the gas and the state and all of that so they introduced is the example one that they use yeah so there's the guest hypervisor communication block effectively it's a shared page at the guests in hypervisor can use and be like hey I need the hypervisor can be like hey I need this information and they guess we'll share it over that So anyway, so SCV is just like that encrypted State part. Talking about the actual attack here you'll notice in the tile. No security without integrity. Basically, so with until you've got a message or with like sgx, you've got a message authentication code that's stored with this encrypted memory so you can temper with it, but it does eat up extra memory because every block of memory you have also needs an auth code attached to it. So you're constantly eating up a little bit of extra memory because of encryption AMD you chose to go away with that and doesn't have a message authentication code. Therefore there's no Integrity guarantee. So even though the hypervisor can't read the data they can modify the data without being with him. Yeah, and so I'm actually going to call out one of our challenges off of zero X zero, five three nine dotnet And the reason why when I call that out is I wrote a challenge called crypto cookies. Yeah and crypto cookies. Its old name was actually a hmac question mark x x left can't talk today but others by the way, well, I'm going to talk about the type of issue that's there. Yes, but the gist of this one. is this of the crypto cookies attack is it's a crypto tact that relies on not having any authentication checks so you can start messing with what's there exactly what these guys kind of do so if you want to play around with this type of crypto attack this is at least an option for you to take a look at if you care to only seven solves so not a lot of people have but it's it's in my opinion of pretty basic crypto issue the SCV one here is a little bit more involved but the core idea is the same in this case and in the challenge case it's using ECB in the actual case here with SCV it's using X or and cryptex or so it has the key xor's the data encrypted xor is the data again man into actually little bit more involved than that yet to but but the gist of this is without the attend ocation existing on the crypto Oh, yeah, if you can know where your dad is going, like let's just say you can get a bunch of A's into memory. You can take that block of A's and you could go place it anywhere you want and memory and you know, that that contains a bunch of A's encrypted that's not very useful but you could say encrypt a string that become some x64 instructions for example, and then you can go in place that somewhere memory and code because this is talking about a compromise hypervisor so they can modify all the memory.

And to do this their goal was to write their own memory allocator called Marcus which can mitigate use after fries with low overhead costs. That was their goal in the paper. And the way they do this.

How would this do it on like even nginx or Apache or as you know some runtime like that? I mean anything you've mentioned the Curtis but yeah, I like it.

Yeah, I think the I read it and some of the cool stuff was around the mem copy mostly because if you look at the bug originally it's basically doing a negative size to mem copy which went mem copy takes a nun size onion unsigned sighs. So negative size is really just going to be a very large size which typically isn't very easy to exploit because you know, if you try to write like 2 billion bytes or something you're going to end up. Up hitting unmapped a memory and you're going to crash and that's not what you want. If you want to exploit something unless you just care about a denial of service, but they kind of talk about some weird quirks with mem copy that they found and I forget exactly like why but there was a reason where if you pass something like negative 2 it would actually only end up copying like 64 bytes. I think it was basically it wouldn't copy more than the gap between the source and the destination or something like that. It was kind of weird it wasn't that part was a bit weird to me they didn't explain it too much but it was it was just like some weird quirks and mem copy that kind of it was cut it was pretty cool because it showed a typically unexplainable issue or something that would be very hard to exploit and how they kind of forced it and worked around it to make it an exploitable issue which is something that's like really cool to see an exploitation it's why exploitation is kind of an art you got to have to take something and keep playing with it and playing with it until you manage to find a way

they ended up doing a live stream called the lockdown livestream so while the conference wasn't happy they did have some presentations going on live stream so you can still check them out they did like a virtual conference kind of so I thought that was really cool they did they did it on the 24th I think this is day one they do have two up so they have like a little playlist actually on the same page on the right side if you see there they have a playlist of all the live streams that they did so yeah I think that might be of interest to viewers out there there might be some cool Topics

and a half hours and that's about fuzzing and it looks like it's Colonel fuzzing because they're talking about just call so that looks like it could be an interesting talk that I might want to check out but yeah I think that pretty much summarizes all of our shoutouts I will mention again that I'll be doing a live stream at some point this week looking at realize and I don't know how much I'll be

doing a stream at some point this week probably tomorrow on looking at realize you can also join our Discord or follow us on Twitter if you want to get involved in the community but yeah we'll be back
